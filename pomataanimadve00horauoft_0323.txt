Ille, datis vadibus qui rure extractus in urbem cst,
Solos felices viventes clamat. in urbe.
Cetera de genere hoc, adeo sunt multa, loquacem
Delassare valent Fabium. Nc te morer, audi
Quo rem deducam. Si quis deus, En ego, dicat, 15
Jam faciam quod vultis .· eris ta, qui modo miles,
Mercator : tu, consultus modo, rusticus .· hinc vos,
Vos hinc mutatis discedite partibus. Eia,
Quid statis ‚9—n01int. Atqui licet esse beatis.
Quid causae est, merito quin illis Jupiter ambas 20
Iratus buccas inflet, neque se fore posthac
Tam facilem dicat, votis ut praebeat aurem?

Praeterea, ne sic, ut qui jocularia, ridens
Percurram ε quamquam ridentem dicere verum
Quid vetat? ut puer-is olim dant crustula blandi 25

and in the laws.’'—·10. Sub galli cantum, &c. “ When a client knocks
by cock-crow at his d001·.”—ll. Ille, datis vadibus, &c. ‘⁶ He, who,
having given bail for his appearance, has been forced from the country
into the city.'’ The allusion is to the defendant in a suit. In the
Roman courts of law, as in our own, the plaintiff required that tho
defendant should give bail for his appearance in court, (vades,) on a
certain day, which was usually the third day after. Hence the plaintiff
was said vadari reum, and the defendant vades dare, or vadimonium
promittere. ——14. Fabium. The individual here named appears to have
been a loquacious and tiresome personage, but whether a philosopher or a
lawyer is uncertain. -15. Quo rem deducam. “ To what conclusion 1
will bring the whole affair) ‘.—18 stlutatis partibus. “ Υ our conditione
in lise being changed.5 ’—19. Nolint.⁴·T11ey will be unwilling to accept the
offer.’'——-The subjunctive is here employed, because the sentence depende
on Si quis dicat which precedes. -Atqui licet esse beatis. “ And yet
they have it in their power to be happy. ’' A Graecism for licet iis esse
beatos. —20. Merito quin illis, διο. ‘Why justly offendcd Jove may
not puff out against them both his cheeks! The poet dmws rather a
ludicrous picture of angry Joxe swelling with indignation. Perhaps,
however, it is on this very account 111010 iu keeping with the context.—

of this kind in a laughing way, as they who handle sportive themes.''—-
25. Olim. '¹‘ Sometimes-’'-fflL Doctores. “ Tcachers.'’ The poet
institutes a comparison‚ no less amusing than just, between the pedagogue
on the one hand, and the Aesopcan οι· Socratic 1ustructor on the other.
The former bribes his little pupils “ to learn their letters,” by presente of
“ cake ;’' the latter makes instruction palatable to the full-grown children
whom he addresses, by arraying it in a garb of mirth and pleasantry.—27.
