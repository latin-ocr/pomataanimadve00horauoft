SERMONUM Lm. 11. 3. 319

Insanum te omnes pueri clamentque puellae : 130

Quum laqueo uxorem interimis, matremque veneno,

Incolumi capite es 2 Quid enim? Neque tu hoc facis

Argis,

N ec ferro, ut demens genitricem occidit Orestes.

An tu reris eum occisa insanisse parente,

Ac non ante malis dementem actum Furiis, quam

In matris jugulo ferrum tepefecit acutum?

Quin ex quo habitus male tutae mentis Orestes,

Nil sane fecit, quod tu reprendere possis :

Non Pyladen ferro violare aususve sororem est

Electram : tantum maledicit utrique, vocando 140

Hanc Furiam, hunc aliud, jussit quod splendida 111113.
Pauper Opimius argenti positi intus et auri,

Qui Veientanum festis potare diebus

131—141. 131. Quum laqueo uoeorem interimis, 810. Τ110 scene
again changes, and the Stoic now addresses one who had strangled 111-ι
wife, to get into possession of a rich portion; and another who had
poisoned his mother, in order to attain the sooner to 3 rich estate.
Thus avarice is regularly conducted through all its degrees, until it
ends in murder and parricide—132. Quid enim ,⁹ “ And why not ΓΝ
Stertinius, at first, ironically concedes, that the individual in question
is not insane, because, forsooth, he neither killed 1113 mother at Argos,
nor with the sword as Orestes did ; just as if the place or instrument
had any thing to do with the criminality of the act. After this, how-
ever, he changes to a serious tone, and proceeds to show that Orestes,
in fact, was the least guilty of the two. The latter slew his mother,
because, contrary to the common belief, the furies maddened and
impelled him to the deed t but the moment his mother fell beneath his
hand, insanity departed, and reason returned. Whereas the person
whom the Stoic addresses, aster having committed crimes to which
nothing but his own inordinate desire of riches prompted him, is still
as insane as ever 111 adding to his store.—137. Quin ecc quo habitus
male tatae, &c. “ Moreover, from the time that Orestes was commonly
regarded as of unsound mind.” The expression male tutae is here
equivalent to male sanaem—139. Pyladrn. Pylades, the well-known
and intimate friend of Orestes.--l4l. Splendida bilis. “ High—toned
choler.” The Stoic will have it that Orestes was not insane after he had
slain Clytemnestra, but only in 11 state of high-wrought excitement.
'I‘his statement, so directly in opposition to the common account, may
either be a discovery of the Stoic‘s himself, or else Horace may have
followed a different tradition from that which Euripides adopted.

142-155. 142. Pauper Opimius, ἃς. Another instance of the
insanity of avarice. ‘⁶ Opimius, poor amid silver and gold, hoarded up
within.”-l43. Veientanum. Understand vinum. The Veientan wine,
his holiday beverage, described by Porphyrion as being of the worst
