Injuste totum ducit venditque poema. ἵε
Indignor quidquam reprehendi, ndn quia crasse
Compositum illepideve putetur, sed quia nuper;

Nec veniam antiquiS, scd honorem et praemia posci.

Recte necne crocum floresque perambulet Attae

Fabula si dubitem, clament periisse pudorem 80
Cuncti paene patres, ea quum reprehendere coner,

Quae gravis Aesopus, quae doctus Roscius egit:

Vel quia nil rectum, nisi quod placuit sibi, ducunt;

Vel quia turpe putant parere minoribus, et, quae

Imberbi didicere, senes perdenda fateri. 85

chanced to shine forth upon the view ;” ι’. c. has happened to arrest
the attention. Emicare is properly applied to objects which, as in the
present instance, arc more conspicuous than those around, and therefore
catch the eye more numina-75. I injuste tolum ducit venditque po'e‘ma.
⁶² It unjustly carries along with it, and procures the sale of the whole
poem.'' By the use of ducit the poet means to convey the idea, that
a happy turn of expression, or a verse somewhat smoother and more
elegant than ordinary, stamps a value on the whole productim, and,
under its protecting guidancc, cariics the poetical bark,heavily1a‹h.1
though it be with all kinds of absurdities, sat'e into the hasbour of public
approbation.

79-85, 79. Recte necne crocum floresque perambulet, ἃς. “ Were
1 to doubt, whether Atta's drama moves amid the saffron and the
flowers of the stage in a proper manner or n0t‚”&c. The reference
here is to Titus Quinctius, who received the surname of Atta. from a
lameness in his feet, which gave him the appearance of a man walking
on tip-toe. lt is to this personal deformity that Horace pleasantly
alludes, when he supposes the plays of Atti limping over the stage like
their lame author. The Roman stage nas sprinkled with persumed
waters, and streu ed with flouers. W e may eas il) inser from this pas-
sage tlie high reputation in which the di· imas of Atta stood among
the countrymen of Horace. -81, Pan—m ; cquixalent to seniores. -82.
Quae gravis Aesopus, quae doct ,ιε Itos-cius eyit. W‘v hich the dignified
Aesopus, which the skilful Roscius hav'e performed.” Aesopus and
Roscius were two distinguished actors of the day. Cicero makes men-
tion of them both, but more particularly of the latter, who attained to
such eminence in the histrionic art that his name became proverbial ς
and an individual that excelled, not merely in this profession but in
any other, was styled a Roscius in that branch.—84. Alium-ibus,-
equivalent to junioribus. ——85. Perdenda. “Is deserving only of being
destroyed-'³

or priests of Mars, in their solemn procession. This sacerdotal order
