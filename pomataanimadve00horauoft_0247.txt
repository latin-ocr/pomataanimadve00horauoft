the stratagem of the wooden horse, but would have taken the city in
open fight.—Equo filimere-ae sacra mentito. “ 111 the horse that bclied
the worship of Minerva ;” i. e. which was falsely pretendcd to have been
an offen'ng to the goddess—14. Male feriatos. “ Giving loose to fes-
tivity in an evil hour.’'—16. Falleret. Forjifffellisset. SO, iu the 18th
verse, ureret for ussisset.—l7. Palam yravis. ‘⁶ Opcnlyter1·ible.⁷'—-
Nesciosfari pueros. An imitation of the Greek form, νήπια τέκνα.-21.
Fletus. “ Swayed ;” bent from his purpose—22. Vocibus. “ Eutreaties.’'
-Adnuisset. “ Granted.''--23. Potiore ductos alite. ‘⁶ Reared under
more favourable auspices.''

25—39. 25. Doctor Aryivae, &c. “ God of the lyre‚ instructor of
the Grecian muse.'' Thaliae is here equivalent to Musae lyricae, and
Apollo is invoked as the deity who taught the Greeks to excel in lyric
numbers.—26. Xant}zo‚· alluding to the Lycian, not the Trojan Xan-
thus. This stream, though the largest in Lycia, was yet of inconsider-
able size. On its bauks stood a city of the same name, ‘the greatest iu
tbe whole country. About sixty stadia castward from the mouth of the
Xanthus was the city of Patara, famed sor its oracle of Apella—27,
Dauniae defende decus Camenae. ‘⁴ Defend the honour of the Roman
muse ;'' i. e. grant that iu the Secular hymn, which Augustus bids me
compose, Ι may support the honour of the Roman lyre. As regards
Dauniae, here put for Italae, i. e. Romanae, consult the notes on Ode
n. i. 34, and 1. xxii. 13.-28. Levis Ayyieu. “ O youthful Apollo.'’
The appellation Ayyieus is of Greek origin (Ἀγυιεύς), and, if the com-
mon derivation be correct (from ‹it-yma, “ a street''), denotes “the
guardian deity of streets.” It was the custom at Athens to erect small
couical cippi, in honour of Apollo, in the vestibules and before the doors
of their houses. Here he was invoked as the averter of evil, and was
worshipped with per-fumes, garlandS, aud fillets.—29. Spiritum Phoebus
mihi, διε. The bard, fancying that his supplicationi has been heard,
now addresses himself to the chorus of maidens and youths whom he
supposes to be standing around‚ and awaiting his instructions. My
prayer is granted: “ Phoebus has given me poetic inspiration3 Phoebus
has given me the art of song, and the name of a poet.''—3l. Viryinum
