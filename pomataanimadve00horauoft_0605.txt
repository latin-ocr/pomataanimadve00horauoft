EPISTOLARUM LIB. 11. l. 5⁰1

Verum equitis quoque jam migravit ab aure voluptas
Omnis ad incertos oculos et gaudia vana.
Quatuor aut plures aulaea premuntur in horas,
Dum fugiunt equitum turmae peditumque catervae ; 190
Mox trahitur manibus regum fortuna retortis ;
Esseda festinant, pilenta, petorrita, naves ς
Captivum portatur ebur, captiva Corinthus.
Si foret in terris, rideret Democritus ; seu
Diversmu confusa genus panthera camelo, 1:³5
Sive elephas albus vulgi converteret ora :
Spectaret populum ludis attentius ipsis,
Ut sibi praebentem mimo spectacula plura.
Scriptores autem uzu-rare putaret asello

-187, Verum equitis quoqne jam, ἃς. This corruption of tastc now
spreads even to the more educated classes—138. lacertos oculos. ‘⁶ Eves
continually wanden'ng from one object to another? i. e. attracted by
the variety and splendour of the objects exhibited, so as to be uncertain
on which to rest—189. Quacum· aut plures aulaea in horas. “ For four
hours or more is the curtain kept down.'' We have rendered this
literally, and in accordance with the language of former days. 111 the
ancient theatres, when the play began the curtain was drawn down nn-
der the stage. Thus the Romans said tollere aulaea, ‘² to raise the curtam?
when the play was done; and premere aulaea, when the play commenced
and the performers appeared. Horace, therefore, here alludes to a piece
which, for four hours and upwards, exhibited one unbroken spectacle of
troops of horses, companies of suot, διο. In other words, the piece in
question is a mere show, calculated to please the eye, without at all
improving the mind, of the spectator.——I})l. Reyum fortuna. “ The
fortune of kings;'' i. e. unfortunate monarcha—19³2. Petorrita. Consult
note 011 Sat. 1. vi. 104.—Naves. The allusion is supposed to be to the
beaks of ships placed on vehicles, and displayed as the ornaments of a
triumpha] pageant.—193. Captivum eham either richly-wrought articles
of ivory are here meant, or else tusks of elephants (dentes eburnei ).—
Oaptiva Corinthus. “ A captive Corinth ;” i. e. a whole Corinth of
precious and costly articles Corinth, once so rich in every work of}
art, is here used as a general expression to denote whatever is rare and
valuable.

194—207. 194. Democritus. Consult note on Epistle 1. xii. ΓΞ.- -
195. Diversum confusa genus panthera camelo. ‘⁴ A panther mixed with
a camel, a distinct species ;'’ i. e. distinct from the common panther.
The poet alludes to the Cameleopard or Giraffe.—l96. Elephas albus.
white elephants are as great a rarity, almost, in our own days, and
their possession is cagerly sought after, and highly prized, by some
of the Eastern potentates—Converteret. Supply in ,sa—197. Spectaret
populum ludis attentius ipsis, &a “ He would gaze with more attention
on the people than on the sports themselves, as affording him more
strange sights than the very actm-,⁴³ Mimo is here taken in the general
signification of histria—199. Scriptores autem narrare putaret, &c-
