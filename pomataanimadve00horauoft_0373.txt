SERMONUM LIB. 1. 6. 333

Ipse mihi custos incorruptissimus omncs

Circum doctores aderat. Quid multa? pudicum,

Qui primus virtutis honos, servavit ab omni

Non solum facto, verum opprobrio quoque turpi,

Nec timuit, sibi ne vitio quis verteret olim, 85
Si praeco parvas, aut, ut fuit ipse, coactor

Mercedes sequercr; neque ego essem questus. Ad hoc nunc
Laus illi debetur et a me gratia major.

Nil me poeniteat sanum patris hujus, eoque

Non, ut magna dolo factum negat csse suo pars, 90
Quod non ingenuos habeat clarosque parentes,

Sic me defendam. Longe mea discrepat istis

Et vox et ratio. Nam si natura juberet

A certis annis aevum remeare peractum,

Atque alios legere ad fastum quoscunque parentes , 95
Optaret sibi quisque ; meis contentus honestos

Fascibus et sellis nollem mihi sumere, demens

διο. Among the Romans each youth of good family had his paedayoyus,
οι· slave, to accompany him to and from school, and discharge the dutics
of protector and private instructor. The public teachers were called
doctores or praeceptores. The anxious father of Horace, however, will
not trust him even with one of these, but himself accompanies his son.
85—98. 85. Sibi ne vitio quis verteret olim. ‘⁶ Lest any one
might, in after-days, allego it as a reproach against him.”-86. Coactor.
Commentators are divided in relation to the employment pursued at
Rome by the father of Horace. In the life of the poet which is ascn'bed
to Suetonius, his parent is styled, according to the common reading,
exactionum coactor, “ a tax-gathere1·‚'’ or ‘⁴ collector of imposts.”
Gessner, however, suggested as an emendation, eoeauetionum coactor,
“an officer attendant upon sales at auetion, who collected the purchase-
money.’' This correction has been generally adopted.-—87. Parvae
mercedes sequerer. “ 1 should come to follow an employment attended
with petty gains ;'‘ i. e. I should be compelled to follow a mean employ-
ment‚ and one utterly at variance with the education 1 had received.
—87. Ad hoo. ‘⁴ On this account.”—89. Sanum. “ As long as Ι am
in my right senses.''—quue non, ut mayna, &c. ‘⁶ And therefore I
will not seek to excuse myself as a large number do, who declare it to be
owing to no fault on their part that they have not free-born and illustri-
ous parents.”—93. Ec vom et ratio. ⁴⁶ Both my language and senti-
ments.'’—-95. Atque alios leyere ad fastum, &e. “ And to select any
other parents whatever, as might suit our pride.'’-96. Optaret sibi
quisque, διο. “ Each one might choose for himself what parents he
plcased3 contented with mine, I should feel no inclination to take unto
myself such as might even be graced with the fasces and the curule
