336 Q. noRA'rn FLACCI

Vultum ferre negat Noviorum posse minoris.

Ad quartam jaceo ; post hanc vagor, aut ego, lecto

Aut scripto quod me tacitum juvet, ungor olivo,

Non quo fraudatis immundus Natta lucernis.

Ast ubi me fessum sol acrior ire lavatum 125
Admonuit, fugio campum lusumque trigonem.

Pransus non avide, quantum interpellet inani

Ventre diem durare, domesticus otior. Haec est

Vita solutorum misera ambitione gravique.

His me consolor victurum suavius, ac si 130
Quaestor avus, pater atque meus, patruusque fuisset.

merited, and to denote the omnipotence of the lam—Qui se vultumfhrre
neyat, διο. The younger Novius, as the scholiast informs us, was accus·
tomed to carry on his shameful usuries near the statue of Marsyas ; and as
the satyr was represented with one hand raised up, (compare Servius ad
Viry. Aen. iv. 58,) Horace wittily supposes that this was done by him to
show his aversion to such beings as Novius, and to drive them, as it were,
from his presence. ι

122-131. 122. Ad quartam jaceo. “ Ι lie a—bed until the fourth
hour.'⁷ The fourth hour m'th the Romans answered to our ten o'clock in
the morning—Lecto aut scripto quod me, διε. “ After h'avifig read or
written something, that may serve to occup)⁷ my thoughts agreeably‚ when
in a musing mood.'' Lecto and scripto are ablatives, eo being understood.
Some commentators make them verbe, and contracted forms for lectito and
scriptum—124. Non quofraudatis, διο. “ Not with such as the filthy
Natta is, and which he has stolen from his lamps.'' Or more literally,
‘⁶ not with such as the filthy Natta is, his lamps being eheated of their
oil.'’ With fraudatis understand olea—Natta. Understand ungitur.
-126, Fuyio campum lusumque triyonem. “ Ι abandon the Campus
Martius, and the game of ball. ” The game of ball was called pila ἐνέρο-
παῖίε, or trigon, when the parties who played it were placed in a trimgle,
(τρῖγωνον,) and tossed it from one to another: he who first let it come
to the ground was the lesen—127. Pramus non avide, διο. “ Having
taken a moderate dinner, sufficient to prevent my passing the day with
an empty stomach.” The mid-day meal of the Romans was generally
very slight, after riches had increased among them, and the principal

repast was the coena, or supper. The meaning of the poet is, that he “

took little food during the day, but waited until evening.-l28. Domes-
tious otior. ‘⁶ I idle away the rest of my time at home.”—130. His
me consolor victurum suavius. “I comfort myself with the hope
that I will lead a happier existence by such rules as these, '’ διο.-
131. Quaestor. This term is purposely used in place of either Consul
or Praetor, aa containing a satirical allusion to the Quaestors of the day,
and to their rapaeity in accumulating wealth, which characterised so many
of them as frequently to render a quaestorian descent quite other than a
subject of beasting.
