Aedituos habeat belli spectata domique 230
Virtus, indigno non committenda poetae. ⁸
Gratus Alexandro regi Magno fuit ille
Choerilus, incultis qui versibus et male natis
Retulit acceptos, regale numisma, Philippos.
Sed veluti tractata notam labemque remittunt 235
Atramenta, fere scriptores carmine foedo
Splendida facta linunt, Idem rex ille, po'e'ma
Qui tam ridiculum tam care prodigus emit,
Edicto vetuit, ne quis se, praeter Apellcnn
Pingeret, aut alius Lysippo duceret aera ‘240

had dishonoured himself by a neglect of this ωιυῌοῖ Alexander the
Great, who, when master of a vast empire, perceived indeed the import-
ance of gaining a poet to his service ; but, unluckily, chose so ill, that
the encomiums of the bard whom he selected, only tarnished the native
splendour of those virtues which should have been presented in their
fairest hues to the admiration of the world. In his appointment of
artists, on the other hand, this prince showed a much truer judgment ς
for he suffered none but an Apelles and a Lysippus to represent the
form and fashion of his person. But his laste, which was thus exact
and! refined in what concerned the mechanical execution of the fine
arts, took up with a Choerilus to transmit an image of his mind to
future ages: so grossly undiscerning was he in works of poetry and
the liberal offerings of the muse—230. Aeclituos. “Ministersst' or
·· keepers.” The aeditui were those who took charge of the tem ples as
keepers or wesema—233. C'lzoerz'ltcs; a poet, in the train of Alex-
ander, who is mentioned also by Quintus Curtius (v111. v. ὃ), Ausonius
(Ep. 16), and also by Acron and Porphyrion. Alexander is said to
have promised him a piece of gold for every good verse that he made
in his praise. It is also stated, that this same poet having, by a piece
of presumption, consented to receive a blow for every line of the Pane-
gyric on Alexander which should be rejected by the judgeS, suffered
severely for his folly. There were several other poets of the same
name.—Incultis qui versibus et 'male natis, occ. “ who owed to his
rough and ill-formed verses the Philippi, royal coin, that he received.''
Acron, in his scholium on the 357th verse of the Epistle to the Pisos,
relates, that Alexander told Choerilus, he would rather be the Thersites
of Homer than the Achilles of Choerilus. Some commentators have
therefore supposed that Horace has altered the story, in order the better
to suit his argument, and that, if Alexander did bestow any sum os
money upon Choerilus, it was on condition that he should never write
about him agaim—234. Philippos. Gold pieces‚ with Philip's head
upon them, thence called Philippi.

‘235—245. 235. Sed veluti tractata notam labemque remittunt, διε.
“But as ink, when touched, leaves behind it a mark and a stain, so
writers, generally speaking, soil by paltry verse distinguished actions.¹'
—240. Alius Lysippo. “Any other than Lysippus.'' Compare the
Greek idiom ἄλλος Λυσίππου, of which this is an unitation.—-Duceret
