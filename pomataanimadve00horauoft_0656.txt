with the humour of their auditors, deemed it advisable to combine this
ludicrous exhibition with their graver pieces. One Satyric Drama, was
added to each tragic trilogy, as long as the custom of contending with
a series os plays, and not with single pieces, continued. AEschylus,
Sophocles, and Euripides, were all distinguished Satyric composers ς
aud in the Cyclops of the latter we possess the only extant specimen
of vthis singular exhibition. (Theatra qf the Greeks, 2d. ed. p. 111.
seqq.)—Et asper irwolumi gravitate jocum tentat-it. ‘¹ And with rough
sarcasm essayed the joke, though without abandoning the gravity of the
sub'ect.‘'

2424—229. 224. Functnsque sacris, et potus, et exlex. “Just come
from festal sites, full of the fumes of wine, wild and ungovernable.'’—.-
225. Verum ita risores, ἃς. “It will be expedient, however, in such
a way to recommend the bantering, in such a way the rallying Satyrs,
to the favour of the audience, in such a way to turn things of a serious
nature into jest, that whatever god, whatever hero shall be introduced,
he may not, conspicuous a moment ago in regal gold and purple,
descend, by means of the vulgar language he einploys, to the low level
of obscure taverns 3 nor, on the other hand, while he spuriis the ground,
grasp at clouds and empty space.'’—229. Migret ιἰι obscuras, &Q The
former of these fauhs, observes Hurd, a low and vulgar expressiomin
the comic parts, humili sermone, would almost naturally adher-e to the*
first esssays of the Roman satyrio drama, from the buffoon-genius of
the Atellanae z and the latter, a language too sublime in the tragic part,
nubes et inania captet, would arise from not apprehending the true measure
and degree of the tragic mixture. To correct both these, the poet gives
the exactest idea of the Satyric Drama, in the image of a Roman matrort
§haring in the mii-th of a religious festival. The occasion obliged to
some freedoms, and yet the dignity of her character demanded a decent
reserve.

231—235. 231. Indigna. “Disdaining.”—232. Ut festis matrona-
moveri jussa diebus. The verb moveri is here equivalent to saltare.—
233. intererit. “Will mingle.'’— Paulum pudibunda. “With some
degree of modest reserve.⁷'—-234. Non ego honorata et dominantia
