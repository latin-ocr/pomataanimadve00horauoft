EPISTOLA AD PISONES. 591

Sed non ut placidis coeant immitia: non ut
Serpentes avibus geminentur, tigribus agni.

Inceptis gravibus plerumque et magna professis
Purpureus, late qui splendeat, unus ct alter 15
Assuitur pannus ; quum lucus ct ara Dianae,

Et properantis aquae per amoenas ambitus agros,

Aut flumen Rhenum, aut pluvius describitur arcus.

Sed nunc non crat his locus. Et fortasse cupressum

Scis simulare: qui hoc7 si fractis enatat exspes 20

desence of their transgressions against the law of τιήρῃ-12. Sed mm
utplacidis co‘c'ant immitia, ecc. The meaning is, that poetic-<il or any
other license must never be carried so far as to unite things that are
plainlv and naturally repugnant to each ethera—14. Iac-eptis gravibus
pler-unique et magna profess-ts. ἃς. ‘¹ O‘tentimes to lofty beginnings‚
and such as promise great things, are sewed one or two purple patches‚
in order to make a brilliant display,'’ «Sec. 3 i.e. often. after exordiums
os high attempt and lol'ty promise, we are amused with the description
of a grove and altar of Diana, the meanders of a stream gliding swiftlv
through pleasant fields, the river Rhine, or a rainbow, like so man'y
purple patches iu a garment‚ that make. it is true, a great show, but
then are not in their proper place. The poet here considers and
exposes that particular violation ol'uniformity, into which young poete
especiallv‚ under the influence of a warni imagination, are too apt
to run, arising from frequent and ill-timed descriptions.

19, 20. 19. Etfortasse cupressum scis simulare, διο. Horace com-
pares the poets‚ whom he has just been censuring, to a painter who had
learned to draw nothing but a cypress-tree. As this painter, therefore,
would represent the cypress in every picture he was engaged to execute,
so these poets, altogether uuequal to the management ofauy individual
subject in a proper way, and with aproper regard to unity of design‚
were accustomed to indulge iu insulated descriptions, and in common-
place topics‚ which had no bearing whatever on the main subject.
Hence the words etfortasse cupressum scis simulare, ἃς. convey, in fact,
the following meaning: Perhaps, tos», thou art even skilful in these
individual descriptious, as the painter who knew only how to draw a
cypress. But what have such ‹lescriptions and common-place topics
to do with the subject itself‘! Evidently,just as much as if the painter
alluded to were to place his darling eypress on the canvass‚ when
emploved to draw a picture of shipwreck.—⁰20. Quid hoc. sifi-actis
enatat‘exspes, ἃς, ‘¹ What is this to the purpose, if he, who is to be
painted for a given price, is to be represented as swimming forth
hopeless from the fragments of a wreck !'' Persons who had 1031 their
all by shipwreck. were accustomed to solicit charity b carrying around
with them a painting in which the missortune which ad befallen them
was depicted. In the present case, therefore, Horace supposesa ship-
wrecked mariner to have employed a painter for this purpose who knew
onlv how to draw a cvpress, and he asks of what value such an object
would be in the intended picture, or how it could have any effect in
exciting the compassion of others?
