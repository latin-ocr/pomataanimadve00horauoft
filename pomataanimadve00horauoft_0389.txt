skirts of the poor bard3 the desire, namely, of an introduction through
him to Maecenas.—Pancorum hominum et mentis bene sanae, &m
⁴‘ He is one that has but few intimatos, and in this he shows his good
sense. No man has made a happier use of the favours of fortune.’'
The poet, easily diviniug the object of his persecutor, does not give a
direct answer to his question, but puts him off with such a reply as may
crush at once all his hopes. The idea intended to be conveyed by the
expression Nemo deaeeerz'us fortuna est usus, is simply this, that Maece-
nas enjoys the gifts of fortune with moderation, aud as they should be
enjoyedg and that his abodc is neither the dwelling of parasites and flat-
terem on the one hand, nor of the mere tools and instruments of pleasure
on the other.

and plainly with bium—49. Domus hac nec purior ulla est, ἃς. “ Νο
house is marked by more purity of principle than this, nor is freer from
these evils.’' By mala aro here meant jealousies and rivalehips, with
their attendant evils.—50. Nil νηΐ officit inquam. “ It gives me, Ι tell
thee, no umbmge.''—52. Atqui sic habet. ‘⁸ And yet it is even as I
say.”—53. Illi ‚· alluding to Maecenas.—54. Velis tantummodo ,· quae
tua virtus, διο. Bittcr irony. ¹⁴ Thou hast only to entertain the wish :
such is thy merit, thou wilt carry cverything before thee.’' The ellipsis
in quae tua virtus must be applied as follows z ea virtute, quae tua virtus
esa—55. quue. “And sor that very reason;'' i. e. and because he
