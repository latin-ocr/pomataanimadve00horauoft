580 Q. HORATII FLAOCI

Si tibi nulla sitim finiret copia lymphae,

N arrares medicis: quod, quanto plura parasti,
Tanto plura cupis, nulline faterier audes ’ἒ

Si vulnus tibi monstrata radice vel herba

Non fieret levius, fugeres radice vel herba 150
Proficiente nihil curm-ier. Audieras, cui
Rem di donarent, illi decedere pravam
Stultitiam3 et, quum sis nihilo sapientior, ex quo
Plenior es, tamen uteris monitoribus isdem ἓ
At si divitiae prudentem reddere possent, 1⁵5
Si cupidum timidumque minus te 3 nempe ruberes,
Viveret in terris te si quis avarior uno.
Si proprium est, quod quis libra mercatus et aere est,

Horace the more easily to correct his ambition, avarice, and those other
vices to which he was samech—146. Si libi nulla sitim finiret copia
lymphae, &a This was a way of reasoning employed by the philosopher
Aristippus, as Plutarch has preserved it for 115 111 his Treatise against
Avarice. He who eats and drinks a great deal, without allaying his
appetite, has recourse to physicians‚ wants to· know 1115 malady, and
what is to be done for a cure. But the man who has already five rich
beds‚ and thirsts after ten; who has large possessions and store of
money, yet is never satisfieri, but still desires more, and spends day and
night in heaping up: this man, I say, never dreams of applying for
relief', or of inquiring after the cause of his nialady.—151. Audieras,
eui rem di donarent, ἃς. The stoics taught that the wise man alone
was rich. But there were others who overturned this doctrine, and
maintained the direct contrary. Horace, therefore, reasons against this
latter position, and endeavours to show its absurdity. Thou hast been
always told that riches banished folly, and that to be rich and to be wise
were the same 3 but thou hast satisfied thyself that the increase of thy
riches has added nothing to thy wisdom, and yet thou art still hearken-
ing to the same deceitful teachers.—l5·2. Illi decedere ; equivalent to
ab eo suffera—153. Et quum sis m‘lzilo sapientior, ετ quo plenior es.
‘⁶ And though thou art nothing wiser, since thou art become richer.”——
156. Nempe. “Then indeed.”

158, 159. 158. Si proprium est, quod quis libra mercatus et aere est,
«Sco. ‘² If what one buys m‘th all the requisite formalities is his own
property 3 011 the other hand, there are certain things, to which, if thou
believest the lawyers, use gives a right.” The expression quod quis
libra mercatus et aere est, (literally, “ what one has purchased with the
balance and piece of money,”) refers to the Roman mode of transferring
property. In the reign of Servius Tullius money was first coined at
Rome, and that, too, only of brass Ρ10110115 to this every thing went
by weight.1n the alienation therefore of property by sale, 35 well as
in other transactions where a sale, either real or imaginary ‚formed a
part, the old Roman custom was always retained, even as late as the
days of Horace, and later. A libripen3‚ holding a brazen balance,
