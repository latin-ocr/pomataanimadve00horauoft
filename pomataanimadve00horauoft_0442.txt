400 Q. HORATII FLACCI

&heffa-,M

(Quiddam magnum addens) unum me surpite morti,

Dis etenim facile est, orabat3 sanus utrisque

Auribus atque oculis ,· mentem, nisi litigiosus, ‘285

Exciperet dominus, quum venderet. Hoc quoque vulgus

Chrysippus ponit fecunda in gente Meneni.

Jupiter, imperate-s· qui das adimisque dolores,

Mater ait pueri menses jam quinque cubantis,

F riyida sipzcerum quartana reliquerit, illo ‘290

DIcme die, quo ta indicis jejunia, nudas

In Tiberi stabit. Casus medicusve levarit

Aegrum ex praecipiti, mater delira necabit

In gelida fixum ripa, febrimque reducet.

Quone malo mentem concussa? timore deorum. 295*
Haec mihi Stertinius, sapientum octavus, amico

Arma dedit, posthac ne compellerer inultus.

Dixerit insanum qui me, totidem audiet, atque

Respicere ignoto discet pendentia tergo.

from death.” Surpite is for surripite.—283. Quiddam maynrtm adden-³.
What magnum refers to, the poet purposely leaves uncertain. The allu-
sion, probably, is to some vow,—285. Nisi litiyiosus. Masters were
bound, if they warranted a slave at the time of sale, to make that war-
ranty a full and perfect one. When the seller gave a false account, or
omitted to mention any defects, the purchascr had a right of action
against hini—287. Meneni. A passing thrust at some individua] of the
day, remarkable for his stupidity and folly, and who is here honoured by
being placed at the head of a whole family as it were of thola—288.
Jupiter, inyentes qni das, &a A beautiful instance of superstition is
here given. A mother begs of Jupiter to cure her son, and at the same
time makes a vow, the fulfilment of which, on her part, will bring certain
death to him—289. Menses jam quinque cubantis. “Who has been
s lying sick now for five m011ths.”—290. Illo mane die, quo tu indicis, &c-

“ On the morning of that day, when thou dost appoint a fast, naked
¹ shall he stand in the Tiber.'' The commentators seem generally agreed,
that the (lay here alluded to is Thursday, (dies Jovis‚) and that the satire
of the poet is levelled at the superstitious observanceS, of Jewish and
Egyptian origin, which had begun about this time to be introduced
among the lower classes at Rome. The placing of her son in the Tiber
appears to be an imitation, on the part of the superstitious mother, of
some Egyptian rite.

293—298. 293. Eoe praecipiti. “ From his imminent danger ;'' i. e.
from the dangerous nialady which threatens his life—295. Timore
deorum. Compare the Greek expression δεισιδαιμονίᾳ-296. Haec
milii Stertinius, &c Damasippus, after recounting his interview with
Stertinius, and the remarks of the latter, now resumes the conversation
in person with Horace, which had been broken off at verse 41.-297‚
