‘¹ It is not every judge who can discern the want of harmony in poem53
and an improper indulgence is therefore extended in this case to the
Roman poets.'’ Horace remarks, that it is not every one who is capable
of marklng the want of modulation and harmony in a poem, and that,
by reason of this, an improper license has been extended to the Roman
poets iu matters of versification. He then asks whether, in consequence
of such a privilege being allowed, he ought to fall into the common
track, and write in a careless rambling manner? In other words,
whether the negligen'ce of other and earlier bards is deserving of
imitation? The answer is concisely given, and amounts to this, that
accuracy of versification can never be disponsed with, since it consti-
tutes so small a portion of poetical merit; and if one be without it, he
can hardly lay claim to the appellation ol' poet. For suppose 1 think
all eyes will be turned to any faults that 1 inay commit in the structure
of my verses, and am therefore on my guard against errors of this kind3
what have 1 gained by so doing? Ι have only avoided censure, not
merited pransa—²265. Ut omnes visuras peccam putem mea. “suppose
I think that every one will see whatever faults I may commit.'' Ut
putem is equivalent here to sac me putum—268. Exemplar& Graeca.

271, 272. 271. Nimium patienter utrumque, 540, It has been
thought strange, observes‘ Hurd, that Horace should pass so severe a
censure on the wit of Plautus, which yet appeared to Cicero so adrni-
rable that he speaks os it (cle Off. i. 29.) as elegans, urbanum, inge-
niosum, facetam. Nor canit bc said, that this ‹litterence of judgment
was owing to the improved delicacy of the taste for wit in the Augustan
age, since it does not appear that llorace's own jokes, when he attempts
to divert us in this way, are at all better than Cicero’s. The common
answer, so far as it respects thewpoen is, I believe, the true one3 that
endeavouring to beat down the excessive veneration of the elder Roman
poets, and, among the rest, of Plautus, he censu'r'es', without reserve,
every the least det'ect in his writings, though in general he agreed with
Cicero in admiring him—27⁶2. Si modo ego et vos, 8εο. “ lf you and
