232 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Non ut juvencis illigata pluribus 25
Aratra nitantur mea ε
Pecusve Calabris ante sidus fervidum
Lucana mutet pascuis :
Nec ut superni villa candens Tusculi
Circaea tangat moenia. 30
Satis superque me benignitas tua
Ditavit : haud paravero,
Quod aut, avarus ut Chremes, terra premam,
Discinctus aut perdam ut nepos.

thee more extensive possessione, the usual rewards of military service, but
in the spirit of disinterested affection, and with the hope of securing still
more firmly thy friendship and esteem.-—25. Non ut juvencis, &c.
An elegant hypallage for non ut plures juvenci illigati meis aratris
nitantur. ‘⁶ Not that more oxen may toil for me, yoked to my ploughs;'’
i. e. not that Ι may have more extensive estates.—27. Pecusve Calabris,
&a “ Nor that my flocks may change Calabrian for Luc-anian pastures‚
before the burning star appears ς ” i. e. nor t'nat I may own such nume-
rous flocks and herds as to have both winter and summer pastures. An
hypallage sor Calabra pascua mutet Lucanis. The more wealthy
Romans were accustomed to keep their flocks and herds in the rich
pasturcs of Calabria and Lucania. The m1ld climate of the former coun-
try made it an excellent region for winter pastures ; about the eud of June,
however, and a short time previous to the rising of the dog-star, the in-
creasing heat caused these pastures to he exchanged for those of Lucania, a
cool and woody country. On the approach of winter, Calabria was revisited.
—29. Nec ut superni, διο. “ Nor that my glittering villa may touch
the Circaean walls of lofty Tusculum ·‚ ‘' i. e. nor that my Sabine villa may
he built of white marble, glittcring beneath the rays of the sun, and be so
far extended as to reach even to the walls of Tusculum. The distance
between the poet’s farm and Tusculum was more than twenty-five miles.
—Canden83 alluding ⁴to the style of building adopted by the rich.—
Tusculz‘ Circaea moenia. Tusculum was said to have been founded by
Telegonus, the son of Ulysses and Circe. Compare Ode 111. xxix. 8.
33—34. 33. Chremes. Acron supposes the allusion to bc to Chre-
mes, a character in Terence. This, however, is incorrect. The poet
refers to one of the lost plays of Menander, eutitled the ‘⁶ Treasure‚''
(Θησαυρός,) an outline of which? is given by Donatus in his notes on the
‘⁶ Eunuch” of Terence. (Prol. 10.) A young man, having squandered his
estate, sends a servant, ten years after his father's death, according to
the will of the deceased, to carry provisions to his father's monument:
buthe had before sold the ground, in which the monument stood, to a
covetous old man, to whom the servant applied to help him to open the
monument3 in which they discovered a hoard of gold and a letter. The
old man seizcs the measure, and keeps it, under pretence of having
deposited it there, for safety during times of war, and the young fellow
goes to law with him—34. Discinotus aut perdam uc nepos. “ Or
