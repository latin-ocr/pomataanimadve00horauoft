Qui, quid sit pulchrum, quid turpe ; quid utile, quid non,

Planius ac melius Chrysippo et Crantore dicit.

Cur ita crediderim, nisi quid te detinet, audi. 5

Graecia Barbariae lento collisa duello,

takes to be the main design of his two poems. He finds that the works
of this admirable poet arc one continued lesson of wisdom and virtue,
and that he gives the strongest picture of the miseries of vice, and the
fatal consequences of ungererncd passion. From this he takes occa-
sion to launch forth in praise of wisdom and moderation, and shows,
that, to be really happy, we must lcarn to have the. command of our-
selves. The passions are headstrong, unwilling to listen to advice, and
always push us on to extremities. To yield to them is to engage in a
series of rash and inconsiderate steps, and create matter of deep regret
to ourselves in time to come. A present gratification, thus obtained, is
a dear purchase, and what no wise man will covet.

1-3. 1. illaoeime Lolli. “Eldest Lollius.'' Understand natu. The
individual here addressed would appear to have been the son of M. Lollius
Palicanus, who was consul with Q. AEmilius Lepidus—2. Dum tu
declamas Romae. “ Whilst thou art exercising thyself at Rome in the
art of public speaking.” Young persons of distinction at Rome, whose
views were directed towards a public life, were accustomed to exercise
themselves in oratory by declamations in private on feigned subjecte, and
it is to this practice that the text alludes.--Praeneste releyi. “ I have
read over again at Praeneste.'' Consult note on Ode 111. iv. 23.—3.
Pulchrum· “ Becoming.” Analogous to the τὸ καλόν of the Greeks.
—Quid ηοη. ⁴· What injurious.'' The poet. does not merely mean what
is simply useless, but what also brings injury along with it. -

4—8. 4. Planius. “ More clearly.‘¹'—G'lzrysippo. Consult note on
Sat. 1. lii. 127.—Cranlore. Crantor was a philosopher of the Old Aca—
demy, who studied under Xenocrates and Polemo. He adhered to the
Platom'c system, and was the first that wrote commentaries on the works
of Plato-6. Fabula, qua Paridis propter, &e The poet now proceeds
to substantiate his position, that Homer, by various examples of folly,
crime, unlawful passion, and anger, on the one hand, and wisdom, piety,
virtue, and moderation, on the other, accurately delineated, and forcibly
placed before the eyes of his readers, conveys the lessons of philosophy
with greater clearness and better success than either Chrysippus or
Crantor. Fabula must here be rendered, “the story.”—7. Barbariae
lento collisa duello. ‘⁶ To have been engaged in conflict, during a long
protracted war, with a barbarian land ;'' literally‚ “to have been dashed
agamst.'’ This line is thought, both from the use of collisa and the
presence of duellum, to have been either taken or imitated from Ennius.
—8. Stultorum reyum et populorum continet aestus. “ Contains a nar-
rative of· the effecte produced by the excited passinus of foolish princes
and then· people.’' Aestus is here equivalent to affectus concitatos.
