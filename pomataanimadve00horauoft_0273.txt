squanoer away like a dissolute spendthrift.'’ Among tho Romans it was
thought effeminate to appear abroad with the tunic looscly or carelessly
girded. Hence cinctus and succinctus are put for industrius, mpeditus,
or ynavus, diligent, active, elever, because they used to gird the tunic when
at work3 and, on the other hand, discinctus is equivalent to iners, mollis,
iynavus, &cm—Nepos. The primitive meaning of this term is “ a grand-
son :'’ from the too great indulgence, however, generally shown by grand—
fathers, and the ruinous consequences that cnsued‚ the word became a
common designation for a prodigal.

Epona 11.-The object of the poet is to show with how much difficulty
a covetous man disengages himself from the love of riches. He, therefore,
supposes a usurer, who is persuaded of the happiness and tranquillity
ofa country life, to have formed the design of retiring into the country,
and renouncing his former pursuits. The latter calls in his money,
breaks through all engagements‚ and is ready to depart, when his ruling
passion returns, and once more plunges him into the vortex of gain,
Some commentatoris, dissutisfied with the idea that so beautiful a descrip-
tion of rural enjoyment should proceed from the lips of a sordid usurer,
have been disposed to regard tho last four lines of the epode as spurious,
and the appendage of a later age. But the art of the poet is strikingly
displayed in the very circumstance which they condemn; since nothing can
show more clearly the powerful influence which the love of riches can
exercise over the mind, than that one who, like Alpinus, has so accurate a
perception of the pleasures of a country life, should, like him, sacrifice them
all on ‘the altar of gain.

‘⁶ Freed from all manner of borrowing and lending ; '³ i. e. from all money
transactions. The interest of money was called senus, or usura. The
legal interest at Rome, toward the end of the republic and under the first
emperors, was one as monthly for the use ofa hundred, equal to twelve
per cent. per annum. This was called usura centesima, because in a
hundred months the interest equalled the capim—5. Neque excitatur, διο.
