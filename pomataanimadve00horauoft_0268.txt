228 Q, HORATII FLACCI

Fruges et agris retulit uberes, 5
Et signa nostro restituit J ovi,
Derepta Parthorum superbis
Postibus, et vacuum duellis

Janum Quirinum clusit, et ordinem
Rectum evaganti frena Licentiae 10
Injecit, emovitque culpas,
Et veteres revocavit artes:

Per quas Latinum nomen et Italae
Crevere vires, famaque et imperi
Porrecta majestas ad ortum 15
Solis ab Hesperio cubili.

battles and victor-ies of Augustus, Apollo reproved him for his rash attempt,
and that he thereupon turned his attention to subjects of a iess daring
nature, and more on an equality with his poetic powers. The hard there-
fore sings of the blessings couferred on the Roman people by the glmious
reign of the monarch--the closing of the temple of Janus—the prevalence
of universal peace—the revival of agriculture—the re-establishment οῐ
laws and public morals—the rekindling splendour of the Roman name.
Hence the concluding declaration of the picce‚ that Augustus shall receive
divine honours, as a tutelary deity, from the hands of a grateful people.

warned me not to spread my little sails over the surface of the Tuscan

tus, is, according to the bard, to venture in a little bark on a broad tem-
pestuous ocean.—5. Fruges uberes. “ Abundant harvests ;'' alluding

of Janus was open in war and closed in peace. It had been closed pre-
vious to the reign of Augustus, once in the days of Numa, and a second
time at the conclusion of the first Punic War. Under Augustus it was
closed thrice: once in A. U. C. 725, after the overthrow of An'tony3
(compare Orosius, vi. 22, and Dio Cassius, li. 20;) again in A. U. C.
729, after the reduction of the Cantabri3 (compare Dio Cassius, liii. 26 3)
