viii PREFACE.

part of an instructor. We have seen Virgss, of late, reduced to the
level of common prose, and all traces of his melodious diction entirely
effaced. Let us hope that Horace may escape a similar calamity.
Metrical knowledge is always worth possessing, it is always the badge
of scholarship ; and to seek to decry it, and to detract from its use-
fulness, is ever the last refuge of incurable dulneSS.

The Explanatory Notes will, no doubt, be thought by some too
extensive in their nature, especially by those who are opposed to “ the
leaving too little for the pupil to do.’' This appears, indeed, to be
the grand discovery of our own times, that the student should be left
to grope his way in utter darkness, be abandoned to his own unaided
efforts, and should waste h1s most valuable moments in fruitless and
misdirected labour, when aid, judiciously bestowed, woqu animatehis
farther exertions, and bear him onward successfully in his career. In
no country is education more frequently made a topic of discussion
than in our own, and in none at the same time is it less clearly under-
stood. The fate of classical learning seems to be peculiarly unfortu-
nate ; and, Sisyphus-like, it only attains an onward movement to be
again brought back to its starting-place. Pretenders to its acquaint-
ance and its influence swarm throughout the land3 but they prove in
fact its worst and most effectual enemies, for the positive mischief

of learning itself. These are the locusts that ravage, in their annual
visitations, the fair fields of classical literature, aud what they leave
uninjured is choked and blighted by the mushroom institutions of the
day, that are springing up in every quarter of our country, to humble
and degrade the character of its scholarslfip, and to make us a bye-
word among the natione. By these miserable sciolists learning is
styled theory, and accuracy, affectation. By these blind and erring
guides the toilsome efforts and the ardent aspirations of the scholar
are stigmatised as pedantry‚ the seclusion of the closet only confers
the appellation of book-worm 3 while they themselves, intuitively
gifted with learning and wisdom, and emancipated from the trammels
of studious exertion, stand forth to the view of their grateful coun-
trymen as beacon lights along the newly-opened paths of intellectual
advaneement Ε

 

 

“ Quod sapio, satis est mihi : non ego curo
Esse quod Arcesilas aerumnosique Solones,

Obsffipo capite, et figentes lumine terrani,

Murmura cum secum, et rabiosa silentia rodunt,
Atque exporrecto trutinantur verba labello,

Aegi-oti veteris meditantes somnia: giyni

De nihilo nihilum. in nihilum nil posse reverti?
