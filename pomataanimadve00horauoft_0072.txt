the allusion to be to the first Brutus. Δ Bentley, also, thinking Catonis
too b‘t'fld, proposes Curti. '

37—40. 37. Reffltlum. Compare Ode iii. 5.—Scauros. The house
of the Scauri gave many distinguished men to the Roman republic.
The most eminent among them were M. Aemilius Scaurus princeps,-
Senatus, a nobleman of great abilsty, an ns son ¹. ι caurus· The
former held the consulship, A.U.C. 639. Sallh‘gt gives an husai-*our-
able acfibiitit of him; (Juy. 153) Cicero, on the other hand, highly&
extols his virtues, abilities‚ and aeliievements, (de Qffi i. 22. et 30;
'Ep‘ ad Lent. i. 9 3 Brut. 29 ; Orat. pro BIaraena, 7). Sallust's ae-
count is evidently tinged with the party-spirit of the day—38. Paullum.
Paullus—Aemilius, consul with Terentius Varro, and defeated along with
his colleague, hy Hannibal, in the disastrous battle of Cannam—Poeno.
“ The Carthaginian.” HannstmL—le. Fabricium. Ὀ. Faflrricins ¹Igus-

expression inbomtis capillisj'refers to the simple andlan-stem manners of

ziz—44. 42. QLLQ M. Furius Camillus, the liberator of his
country from her Galliffinvaders.—-43. Saeva paupertas. As paupertas
retains in this passage its usual signification, implying, namely, a want no't
of the necessarus, but of the comforts, of life, the epithet saeva is no‘t⁴
entitled here to its full force( ‘The clause may therefore be rendered as
follows 2 “ A scanty. fortune, which inuret} to hardship its possessor.”—
Et avitus apso hiim lare salidus. ‘⁴ And an hereditary estate with‘a
dwelling proportioned to it.” The idea intended to be conveyed is, that
curius and Camillus, in the midst of,smnl.y resources, proved far more«
usefulsto their country than if they had been the owners of the most
extensixe possessious, or the votaries of luxury.
