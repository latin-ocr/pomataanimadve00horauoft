EPISTOLARUM Lm. 1. 18. 529

Surge, et inhumanae scnium depone Camenae,

Coenes ut pariter pulmenta laboribus c1nta;

Romanis solenne viris opus, utile famae,

Vitaeque et membris ; praesertim quum valcas, et 50
Vel cursu superare canem vel viribus aprum

Possis: adde, virilia quod speciosius arina

Non cst qui tractet3 scis, quo clamore coronae

Proelia sustineas campestria : denique saevam

Militiam puer et Cantabrica bella tulisti 55
Sub duce, qui templis Parthorum signa refigit

N unc, et si quid abest, Italis adjudicat armis.

Ac, ne te retrahas, ct inexcusabilis abstes,

iu AEtolia. on which occasion Meleager so greatly distinguished himself.
—4T. Et inhumanae scnium depone Camenae. “And lay aside the
peevishness of the unsocial muse ;” i. e. lay aside the pcevish and mo-
rose habits which are superinduccd by unsocial and secluded studies.
Senium properly denotes the peciishness of age, though taken here in a
general sense—48. Pariter. “Along with him.'’-—Pulmenta laboribus
emta. ‘⁴ On the delicious fare purchased by your labours.'’ As regards
the term pulmenta, consult note on Sat. 11. ii. 20.—49. Opus‚· alluding
to the hunt.-52. Adde, virilia quod speciosius arma, effe. The order of
construction is as follows: Adde, quod non est alius qui tractet virilia
arma speciosius te. The term speciosius may be rendered “ more
gracefullyss' and has reference in some degree to the public exhibition
made of one's skill.—53. Quo clamore coronae. “ With what acclama-
tions from the surrounding spectators.''—54. cornipes-tria. “In the
Campus Martius.’'—56. Ducem alluding to Augustus--Qui -templis
Parthorum siyna restyz't nunc. “who is now taking down the Roman
standards from the temples of the Parthians.'’ Consult note on Ode
lv- xv. 6. and 1. xxxi. 3. and also Introductory Remarks, Ode iii. 5. Ac-
oording to Bentley, this epistle was written at the time when Phrahates
restored the Roman standards, Augustus being in Bithynia, Tiberius in
Armenia, and the consulship being filled by M. Appuleius and P. Silius
Nerva. Horace would then be entering his forty-sixth year.—57. Ec
si quid abest, Italis adjudicat armis. “Aiid, it' any thing is wanting to
universal empire, adds it to the Romans by the power of his arms.’'
Bentley thinks that Horace here alludes to the subjugation of Armenia,
the same year in which the Parthians restored the Roman standards.
58—65. 58. Ac, ve te retrahas, et inexcusabilis abstes. “And that
thou mayest not withdraw thyself from such diversions, and stand aloot'
without the least excuse.“’ The train of ideas is as follows: And that
thou mayest not suffer thvself to be kept away from hunting with a
powerful friend, nor be in'duced by some pretence, which ean never
excuse thee, to absent th) sels on such occasions from his presence,
recollect‚ I entreat, that tliou thyself, though careful to observe all the
mles and measures of a just behavio,ur yet sometimes dost indulge' in
amusing sports on thy patenial estate—59. Eaetra numeram modumque.
