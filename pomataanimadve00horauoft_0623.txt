nrisronimum Lm. 11. ³2. 579

In vacuo laetus sessor plausorque theatro; 130
Cetera qui vitae servaret munia recto

More ς bonus sane vicium, amabilis hospes,

Comis in uxorem, posset qui ignoscere servis,

Et signo laeso non insanire lagenae ;

Posset qui rupem et puteum vitare patentem. 135
Hic ubi cognatorum opibus curisque refectus

Expulit elleboro morbum bilemque meraco,

Et redit ad sese : Pol, me occidistis, amici,

N on servastis, ait, cui sic extorta voluptas,

Et demtus pretium montis gratissimus error. 140
Nimirum sapere est abjectis utile nugis,

Et tempestivum pueris concedere ludum3

Ac non verba sequi fidibus modulanda Latinis,

Sed verae numerosque modosque ediscere vitae.
Quocirca mecum loquor haec, tacitusque recordor: 145

illustration of what he has just been asserting. Aristotle (de Mirab.
Auscult. init.) tells a similar story, but makes it to have happened at
Abydos—131. Servaret. “Dischargedss' In the sense of observaret,

to indicate. Hence the expression atra bilis, so frequently used in the
sense of insania.—l40. In place of the common reading pervim, we
have adopted the singularly elegant one which Zarot's edition presents,
in behalf of which we will give the words of Gesner: ‘⁶ Pulcherrimam
sententiam parit lectio Zaroti 3 qua pretium mentis djcitur error yram-
simus,- g. d. facile aliquis sana mente careat, ut tam jucundo errore
fmatur.‘'’

141—156. 141. Nimirum sapere est abjectis utile nafis, δίο. “ Such
being the case, it certainly is better for us to renounce trifles and turn
to the precepts of wisdom, and to leave to youth those amusements
which are more suited to their age.'' The poet now takes a more
serious view of the subject, and this forms the seventh excuse. He has ·
put it last, that he might more naturally fall into the vein of morality
which concludes his epistle. He would convince us, that good sense
does not consist in making verses and ranging words in poetioel har-
mony, but in regulating oui· actions according to the better harmony of
wisdom and virtue: “Sed verae numerosque modosque ediscere vitae.‘'
—145. Quocirca mecum loquor haec, tacitasque recordor. “ It is for
this reason that I commune as follows with myself‚ and silently revolve
