One XIX.—A party of friends, among whom was Horace, intended to
celebrate, by a seast of contribution (ἔρανος), 1110 recent appointment
of Murena to the office of augur. Telephus, one of the number, was
conspicuous for his literary labours, and had been for some time oceu-
pied in composing a history of Greece. At a meeting of these friends,
held as a matter of course in order to make arrangements for the ap-
proaching banquet, it may be supposed that Telephus, wholly engrossed
with his pursuits, had introduced some topic of an historical nature,
much to the annoyance of the bam. The latter, therefore, breaks out,
as it were, with an exhortation 1ο 1115 companion, to abandon matters so

foreign to the subject under discussion, aud attend to things of more im· ·

mediate importance. Presently, fancying himself already in the midst o!
the feast, he iss=1es his edicts as symposia1eh, and regulates the number 01
eups to be drunk in honour of the Moon, of Night, and of the augur Mu-
rena. Then, as if impatient of delay‚ he bids the music begin, and
orders the roscs to be scattered. The ode terminates with a gay allusion
to Telephus.
