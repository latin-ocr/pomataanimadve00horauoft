EPISTOLARCM Lm. 1. l. 453

Ut nox longa, quibus mentitur amica, diesque ‘20
Lenta videtur opus debentibus3 ut piger annus
‘Pupillis‚ quos dura premit custodia matrum :
Sic mihi tarda fluunt ingrataque tempora, quae spem
Consiliumque morantur agendi gnaviter id, quod
Aeque pauperibus prodest, locupletibus aeque, 25
Aeque neglectum pueris senibusque nocebit.

Restat, ut his ego me ipse regam solerque elementis:
N on possis oculo quantum contendere Lynceus,
Non tamen idcirco contemnas lippus inungi;

Nec, quia desperes invicti membra Glyconis, 30 ,

Nodosa corpus nolis prohibere cheragra.
Est quadam prodire tenus, si non datur ultra.

21—23. 21. Opus debentibus. The allusion is a general one to all
who owe the performance of any daily task or labour, either for actual
hire, or from situation and circumstances— U t piyer annus pupillis, oze.
·‘ As the year moves slowly to minoi-s, whom the strict watchfulness of
mothers restmins.” Since minors were not under the quardianship of
their mothers‚ the reference here must of course be to that watchful case

which a parent exercises over her young offspring‚ in restraining them
from the paths of dissipation‚ and teaching them the Iessons of frugality
and vinna—23. Sic mihi tarda fluunt inyrataque tempora, δίε. The
poet, ardently desimus of making a rapid advance in the pursuit of true
wisdom, and perceiving‚ at the same time, how little the actual progress
he had made accorded with his own wishes, well describes by the com-
parisons here employed, the impatience under which he labours at being
withheld from a specdy consummation of what he so earnestly covets.—-
24. Quod aeque pauperibus prodest, locupletibus aeque, ἃς. These lines
contain a true and well-merited eulogium on wisdom 3 for, as it is what
equally concerns rich and p00r; and what, when neglected, proves equally
injurious to young and old, it naturally follows that the study of it ought
to be our first care, as being cssential to our happiness.
27-—3-1. 27. Restat, ut his eyo me, διο, The connexion in the train
· of ideas is as follows :—Since I cannot then embrace in its full extent
that wisdom which I so earnestly desire, “it remains for me to govern
and console myself by these first principles'of philosophy.” The maxim
which the poet proceeds to inculcate is this : Never aimat any thing
beyond the powers which nature has bestowed on thee, but use care and
diligence in their preservation and improvement. This position is illus-
trated by two examples : who is so wanting in judgment as, because he
has not the keenness of sight which Lynceus is fabled to have possessed,
to neglect the care of his eyes? or who, because he cannot boast of a
frame like that of Glycon, will take no pains to remove or avert diseases
from the one that he has 12—30. Glyconis. Glycon was a famous gladi-
ator in the time of Horace—32. Est quadam prodire tenus, διο. “ It
