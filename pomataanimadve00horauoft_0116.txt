Te pauper ambit sollicita prece, 5
Ruris, colonus ς te dominam aequoris,
Quicunque Rithyna lacessit

Te Dacus asper, te profugi Scythae,
Urbesque, gentesque, et Latium feroit, 10

Ad arma cessantes ad arma 15
Concitet, imperiumque frangat.

Iu this and the following line we have adopted the punctuation recom-
mendcd by Markland, viz. a comma after prece, and aggther after ruris,
which latter word will then depend on dominam understood, and tlie
whole clause will then be equivalent to ρἰἦῷἷῗοοῖοηαε, sollicita prece.

Bithyna. Bithynia, in Asia Minor, was famed for its natural productione,
which gave rise to a very active-commerce between this regio—n- and the

 

 

ca ital of Italy. The expression in the text, however, refers mo're particu-

§tantem columnam equivalent to praesentem felicitatem, and the allusion
of the poet is to the existing state os afflui-s among the Dacians, Scythians,
and others mentioned in the text. Adstanding column was a general
symbol among the ancients of public security. Some editions place a
