sunnonem Lm. 1. 6. 327

Et vixisse probos, amplis et honoribus auctos :

Contra Laevinum, Valeri genus, unde Superbus
Tarquinius regno pulsus fugit, unius assis

Non unquam pretio pluris licuisse, notante

Judiee, quo nosti, populo, qui stultus honores 15
Saepe dat indignis, et famae servit ineptus,

Qui stupet in titulis et imaginibus. Quid oportet

Vos facere, a vulgo longe longeque remotos 2

12—17. 12. Laevinum. We have here an example, on the other
hand, ofa man descended from illustrioris ancestors, but so degraded by
vices as to be held in universal contcnipt.——Valeri yenus, unde, &m
‘⁸ A descendant of that Valerius, by whom,⁷' ἃς. Unde is here for α
quo. The allusion is to the celebrated Valerius Poplicola, who was
elected to the consulship A. U. C. 244, in the stead of Collatinus, and
became the colleaguc of Brutus in that office. From Valerius were
descended the fauiilies of the Laevini, Corvini, Messalae, Catuli, &c.—l3.
Unius assis non unquam, ἃς. “ Has never been valued more highly
than a single as, even when the populace themselves, with whose decision
in matters of this kind thou art well acquainted, estimato his merits as
the judge3 the populace, who often‚'’ δια-15. Quo nosti. By attrac-
tion, in imitation of the Greek idiom, for quem nosti, and equivalcnt
in effect to quem qualis judea: sic nosti. According to the poet’s idea,
Laevinus must be worthless enough, if the populace even think him so,
since they most commonly are blindcd to a person’s defects of cha-
racter by the brilliancy of his extraction—17. Qui stupet in titulis et
imaginibus. “Who are lost in stupid admiration of titles and of
images ς’) 2'. e. of a long line of titled ancestors; an allusion to the Roman
jus imayinum. -

18—19. 18. Vos. The idea intended to be eonveyed is this: If
then the very populace themselves pay but little regard to the nobility
of such a man as Laevinus, “how ought persons like thee to act, who
art far, far, removed in sentiment from the vulgar hcrd ? ’' The answer
is not given by the poet, but may he easily supplied: They should act
even as thou dost; they should disregard, not in one, but in every
instance, the adventitious circumstances of birth and fortune; aud they
should look only to integrity, to an upright and an honest heart.—l9.
IVamque esto, &c. The poet herc gia-cs ix slight turn to his subject in
a somewhat new direction. The connexion in the traiu of ideas
appears to be as follows: Such then being the tme principle of action.
and such the light in which merit, however humble its origin, is
regarded by the wise and good, let those unto whom titled ancestry is
denied repine not at their condition, but remain conteuted with what they
have. For suppose (Namque esto), the people should even be unjust
towards a candidate of lowly birth, or a censor like Appius should
ejeet an individual from the senate because his father had not always
been free, what great hai-m is suffered by this? Is he not rather treated
as he should be? And ought he not to have been contented with his
previous lot, m'th the approbation of those whose good opinion was his
{lest reward, without going on an idle chase after vain and disquieting

onours?
