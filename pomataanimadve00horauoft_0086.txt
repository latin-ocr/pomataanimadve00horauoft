46 Q· HORATII FLAc01

Quis post vina gravem militiam aut pauperiem crepat? 5
Quis non te potius, Bacche pater, teque, decens Venus?
At ne quis modici transsiliat munera Liberi,

Centaurea monet cum Lapithis rixa super mero
Debellata ς monet Sithoniis non levis Euius,

Quum fas atque nefas exiguo fine libidinum 10

to drink freely of wine mixed with water, after dedicating the first §.RD to
Jupiter the Saviour, to remind them of the salubrious quality o the latter
fluid. However much this excellent rule may have been transgressed‚ it is
certain that the Brevailing practice of the-Greeks was to drink their wine in
