sonorous diphthongs of the tabulae peccare vetantes‚which still sound with
such strength and majesty in the lines of Lucretius—24. Quas bis
quinque viri sanxerunt. ‘* Which the Decemviri enacted ;'' ἰ. e. which
the Decemviri, being authorized by the people, proclairned as laws.-—
Foedera regum; alluding to the league of Romulus with the Sabines,
and that of Tarquinius Superbus with the people of Gabii.—·25. Vel
Gabiis vel cum rigidis aequata Sabinis. In construction, cum must be
supplied with Galziis.w[†0113111t note on Epist. 1. xi. 7.

26, 27. 26. Pontificum libros. According to a well-known custom,
manifestly derived from very ancient times, the chief pontiff wrote on
a whited table the events of the year, prodigies, eclipses, a pestilence,
a scarcity, campaigns, triumphs, the deaths of illustrious men (in a
word, what Livy brings together at the end of the tenth book, and in
such as remain of the following ones, mostly when closing the history
of a year) in the plainest words, and with the utmost brevity ; so dry
that nothing could be more jejune. The table was then set up in the
pontiff's house: the annals of the several years were afterwards col-
lected in books. This custom obtained until the pontificate of
P. Mucius, and the times of the Gracchi, when it ceased, because
a literature had now been formed, and perhaps because the composing
such chronicles seemed too much below the dignity of the chief pontiff.
——Annosa volumina vatum; alluding to the Sibylline oracles and other
early predictions, but particularly the former.—‘27. Albano Musas in
monte locutas. A keen sarcasm on the blind admiration with which
the relics of earlier days were regarded, as if the very Muses them-
selves had abandoned Helicon and Parnassus, to come upon the Alban
mount, and had there dictated the treaties and prophecies to which the
poet refers. Under the term Musas there is a particular reference to
the nymph Egeria, with whom, as it is well known, Numa pretended
to hold secret conferences on the Alban mountain. Egeria, besides,
was ranked by some among the number of the Muses. Thus Dionysius
of Halicarnassus remarks: εἘ’περοι δὲ οὐ Νύμφην (scil. τὴν Ἠγερίαν
μυθολογοῦσι) ἀλλὰ τῶν Μουσῶν μίαν (ii. 60).—Albano monte. 'The
Alban mount, now called Allante Caro, had the city of Alba Longa situate '
on its slope, and was about twenty miles from Rome.

28—33. 28. Si, quia Graiorum szcnt antiquissima, διε. “ If, because
the most ancient works of the Greeks are even the best, the Roman
writers are to be weighed in the same balance, there is no need of our
saying much on the subject ;’' i. e. it is in vain to say any thing farther.
-31. Nil intra est olea, nil extra est in nuce duri. “ There is nothing
hard within in the olive, there is nothing hard without in the nut.”
The idea intended to be conveyed by this line, and the two verses that
