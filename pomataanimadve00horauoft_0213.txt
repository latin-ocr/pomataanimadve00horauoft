crown thy little Lares with roscmary and the piian‘c myrtin, to secl< to
-propitiate their favour with the abundant slaughtcr of victims.¹' The
Lares stood in the atrium or hall of tho divelling. On festivals thoy were
crowned with garlands, and sacrifices were offcrcd to them. Consult noto
on Ode 1. vii. 11.—16. Frayili. We have ventured to give the epithct
srayili here the meaning of ‘⁵ pliant‚'’ though it is dne to candour to state,
that this signification of the term has been much disputed. Consult
Mitscherlich ad loa—18. Non sumtuosa blandior hostia, &c. ‘⁴ Not
rendered more acceptable by a. costly sacrifice, it is wont to appense,⁷' &m 3
θ’. e..it appeasos the gods as effectually as if a costly sacrifice xvi-ro<
offered.-20. Farre pio et saliente mica. “ With tho pious cah«-
and the crackling salt;'’ alluding to tho saltcd cuke, (mola salma)
composed of bran or meal mixed with salt, which was sprinldcd on the
head of the victim.

Onu XXIV.—The bard iuveighs bittcrly against the luxury and licen-
tiousness of the age, and against the unprinciplcd cupidity by which they
were constantiy aceompanied. A eontrast is drawn between the pure and
simple manners of barbarian nations and the unbridlcd corruption os his
‹munti-ymen, and Augustus is implored to save the cuipirohy interposing a
ban-ier to the inundation of vice.

1—15. l. Intactis opulentior ἃς. The construction is as follows:
“ Licet. opulentior intactis thesauris Arabum et divitis Indiae, occu-
pes omne Tyrrhenum et Apulia-um mare tuis caementis, tamen si dira
Necessitasflyit‚ ’² &c- “Though wealthici than the yet uni 1fled treasules
of the Ambiaus and of r· :ch India, thou coverest with thy structures all the
Tuscan and Apulian scas, still, if crucl Destiny once fixes her spikes ot
zdamant' m th) head, thou wilt not free thv brcast from sear, thou wilt not
extricato thy life from the snarcs of ‹le..1th’' 'rho epithet intactus, applied
to the treasures of the East‚ refers to their being as yet free trom the grasp
of Roman power. -3. ίάεηιεηιὶε. The term caementa literally means

“stones for filling up. '' Here, however, it refeis to the structuoes reared
on these artificial foundations. —4. Tyrrhenum omne, &c. The Ty rrhe-
nian denotes the lo er, the Apuliam the upper οι· Adriatic, sea. -6. Sum-
tm's vertici? ε. 1ιεῖ meaning wluch we have assigned to this expression
