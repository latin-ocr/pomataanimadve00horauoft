320 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Linquimus, insani ridentes praemia scribae, 35
Praetextam et latum clavum pruna-eque batillum.
In Mamurrarum lassi deinde urbe manemus,
Murena praebente domum, Capitone culinam.
Postera lux oritur multo gratissima, namque
Plotius et Varius Sinuessae Virgiliusque 40

formal Roman way of marking events by consulships ε “ We leave Fundi
during the praetorship of Aufidius*Luscus.''-—Libenter, “In high glee.”
-35. Praemia. “The magisterialinsignia.''—36. Praetea'tam. The
toya praeteoeta was a white robe, bordered with purple, and used by the
higher class of magistrates—Latum clavum. A tunic, or vest, with two
borders of purple, laid like a lace upon the middle or opening of it, down
to the bottom, in such a way that, when the tunic was drawn close, the
two purple borders joined, and seemed to form a single broad one. If
these boi-ders were large, the tunic was called latus clavus, or tunica
laticlavia, and was peculiar to senators; if they were nal-row, it was then
named anqustus clavus, or tunica anqusticlavz'a, and was peculiar to
the knights or equites.—Prunaeque batillum. This appears to have
been a censer, or pan, containing coals of fire, and carried before the
higher magistrates on solemn occasions, for the purpose of burning persumes
in honour of the gods, as the Romans were accustomed to perform no
important act without a previous offering to the gods of some kind or
other. Luscus deems the arrival of Maecenas an occasion that calls for
such a ceremon-y, and he foolishly assumes this badge of dignity among
the rest.

37—38. 37. Mamurrarum urbe. The allusion is to Formiae, now
Mola di Gaeta, a short distance to the south-east of Fundi. According
to the scholiast, Horace calls Formiae the city of the Mamurrae, in allu-
sion to Mamurra, a Roman senator of great wealth, who owned the larger
part of the place. The scholiast, however, forgets to tell us, that the poet
means by this appellation to indulge in a stroke of keen, though almost
imperceptible, satire. Mamurra was indeed a native of Formiae, but of
obscure origin. He served under Julius Caesar, in Gaul, as praefectus
fabrorum, and rose so high in favour with him, that Caesar permitted
him to enrich himself at the expense of the Gauls in any way hc was able.
Mamurra in consequence became, by acts of the greatest extortion, pos-
sessed of enormous riches. and returned to Rome with his ill-gotten
wealth. Here he displayed so little modesty and reserve in the employ-
ment of his fortune, as to be the first Roman that encrus'ted his entire
house, situate on the Coelian hill, with marble. We have two epigrams of
Catullus, iu which he is severely handled. Horace, of course, would
never bestow praise on such a man3 neither on the other hand would he
be openly severe on one whom Augustus favoured. His satire, therefore,
is the keener as it is the more concealed5 and the city of the venerable
Lamian line (Ode 111. xvii) is now called after a race of whom nothing was
known.—Manemus. ‘⁴ We pass the night.” Iu the sense of pernocta-
man—38. Murena praebente domum, διο. The party supped at
Capito's, and slept at Murena’s. The individual last mentioned was a
brother of Terentia, the wife of Maecenas, He was subsequently put to
death for plotting against Augustus.
