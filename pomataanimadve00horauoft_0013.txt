LIFE OF HORACE.

...ᾖ

QUINTUS HORATms FLACCUS was born at Venusia, or Venusium,

a city of Apulia, A. U. C. 689, Β. C. 65. Hls father, a freedman
and client of the Gens Horam, was the proprietor of a small farm m
the vicinity of that place, from which he afterwards removed to Rome,
when his sen had attained the age of nine or ten yearS, in order to
afford him the benefit of a liberal education. While the parent was
discharging, in this great city, the humble duties of an attendant on
public sales, the son was receiving the instructions of the ablest pre-

ceptors, and enjoying in this respect the same advantages as if he had
been descended from one of the oldest families of the capital. Itis
to this circumstance that the poet, in one of his productions, beautifully
alludes; and it would be difficult to say which of the two was entitled
to higher praise, the father who could appropriate his scanty saxings
to so noble an end, or the son who could make mention of that father’ s
care of his earlier years with such manly gratitude and candour.
Orbilius Pupillus, an eminent grammarian of the day, was the first
“ Instructo? of the young Horace, who read with him (though it would
seem with no great relish) the most ancient poets of Rome. The
literature of Greece next claimed his attention, and it may well be
imagined that the productions of the bard of Ionia, while they would
be perused with a hig her zest than the feebler efforts ofa Livius or
an Ennius, would alsog kindle in the bosom of the young scholar the
first spark of that poetic talent, which was destined to prove the orna-

ment and the admiration of his country. About the age of twenty-

one, Horace was sent to Athens to complete his educatiou. The
Academy here numbered fi‘ix'n among its pupils, and he had for his

7 fellow· -disciples the son of Cicero, Varus and the young Messala. It

would appear, however, from the confessions of his maturet years, that
he entertained no very serious attachment to any system of philoso-

phical speculation; and though all his writings breathe an Epicurean
spirit, and he himself sometimes betrays a partiality to that school,
still he rather seems disposed to ridicule the folly of all seem, than to
become the strenuous εὼ ocate for any one of them. During the time
that Horace was residing at Athens, many and important changes had
taken place at home. Caesar had been assas ssinated; Antony was
secking to erect on the ruins of the Dictator’ s power a still more
formidable despotism3 while Qtus and Cassius, the last hopes of
the declining republic‚ were corne*- to Athens 1n order to call to their
standard the young Romans who were pursuing their studies m that
celebrated city. Among the number of those, whom an attachment
to the principles of freedom induced to join the republican party, was
the future bard of Venusia. He continued nearly two years under
the command of Brutus, accompanied him into Macedonia, and, after
attaining there the rank of military tribune, served m that capacity in
the fatal conflict of Philippiz Of his disgraceful flight on this meme-
