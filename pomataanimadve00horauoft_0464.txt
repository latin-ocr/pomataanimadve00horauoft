422 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Ne prior officio quisquam respondeat, terque !

Sive Aquilo radit terras, seu bruma nivalem 25
Interiore diem gyro trahit, ire necesse est.—

Postmodo, quod mi obsit, clare certumque locuto,
Luctandum in turba et facienda injuria tardis.—

Quid tibi vis, insano ,9 et quam rem ciffis improbus ,9 urguet
Iratis precibus ,· tn pulses omne quod obstat, 30
Ad Maecenatem memori .ςὶ monte recurras.—

Hoc. juvat et melli est‚ non mentiar. At simul atras
Ventum est Esquilias, aliena negotia centum

‘⁶ From whom 3” i. e. under whose favouring influence.—2l. Romae
sponsorem me rapis. “When at Rome, thou hurriest me away to
become bail for another.” The address is still to Janus, who is here
supposed to be assigning to each individual his employments for the
day, and among the rest giving his also to the poet—Eia, ne prior
officio, &e. “ Come, make haste! lest any one answer to this call
of duty before thee;” i. e. lest any one anticipate thee in the office of
friendship. This is uttered by the god—25. Radit. “ 5111661183*-
Seu bruma nivalem, &a “ Or whether winter contracte the snowy day
within a narrower circle.”—Bruma (quasi brevima, i. e. brevissima
dies) is properly the winter soistice, the shortest day in the year ι here,
however, it is taken to denote the season of winter generally. The
inequality in the length of the solar day is very beautifully illustrated by
a figure drawn from chariot-races‚ in which the driver who was nearest
the meta or goal, (around which the chariots had to rum) marked a nar-
rower circuit, and was therefore called interior, while those farther off
were obliged to take a larger compass, and were hence styled eoeteriores.
—26. Ire necesse est. ‘⁶ Go Ι must.”—27. Postmodo, quod mi obsit,
&a “After this, when I have uttered, with a clear voice, and in
express words, what may prove an injury to me at some future day,
I must struggle with the crowd, and rough measures must be used
towards those who move slowly along ;” z‘. e. who move at a slow pace
before me, and block up the way. The expression clare certumque
locuto refers to the forniality of becoming· bail for another. After this is
done, the poet leaves the court, and endeavours to make his way through
the crowd. In order to accomplish this, he has to push aside‚ without
much ceremony, all who oppose his progress by their slow and dilatory
movements.

29—35. 29. Quid tihi vis, insane? &c. “What dost thou want,
madman Ρ and what meanest thou by this rude behaviour, exclajms one
of the crowd, pursuing me with imprecations.”—-30. Tu pulses omne
quod obstat, &Q “ Must thou push aside whatever comes in thy way,
if, with a head full of nothing else, thou art running as usual to
Maecenas ?”—31. Rea-arras. The peculiar force of this compound, in
the present instance, as indicating the habitual repetition of an act, is
deserving of notice—32. Hoc javat et melli est. His visits to Maecenas
are here meant—Atros Esqzcz'lias‚· alluding to the circumstance of
this quarter having been a common bun'al-place for the poor, before the
