178 Q. HORATII FLAccx

Exsomnis stupet Euias‚
Hebrum prospiciens, et nive candidam 10
Thracen, ac pede barbaro

Lustratam Rhodopen. Ut mihi devio
Ripae et vacuum nemus
Mirari libet! O Naiadum potens
Baccharumque valentium 15
Proc‘e'ras manibus vertere fraxinos :
Nil parvum aut humili modo,
Nil mortale loquar. Dulce periculum,
O Lenaee! sequi deum

Cingentem viridi tempora pampino. 20

Q) CARMEN XXVI.
AD VENEREM.
VIXI puellis nuper idoneus,
Et militavi non sine gloria ε

N unc arma defunctumque bello
Barbiton hic paries habebit,

and Rhodope traversed by barbarian foot.'' The poet, recovering from the
strong influence of the god, and snrveying with alarm the arduous nature
of the theme to which he has (iared to approach, compares himself to the
Bacchante, whom the stern power of the deity that she serves has driven
onward, in blind carcer, through many a strange and distant region.
Awakening from the deep slnmber into which exhausted nature had at
length been compelled to sink, she finds herself, when returning recol-
lection comes to hcr aid, on the remote mountain-(ops, sar from her
native scenos, and gazes in silent wonder on the prospect before her; the
dar-k Hebrus, the §now-clad fields of Thrace, and the chain of Rhodope
rearing its summits to the skies. Few passages can be cited from any
ancient or modern writer containing more of the true spirit of poetry.—-
10. Hebrum. The modern name of the Hebrus is the Maritza.-12.
Rhodopen. Rhodope, now Dervent, was a Thracian chain, lying along
the north-eastern borders of Macedonia.——12. Ut milli devio, dvc.
“ How it delights me, as I wandel· far from the haunts of men.'’-·—.l3.
Vacuum nemus. “ The lonely g1·0ve.”-14. Ο Naiadum potens, &c.
“O god of the Naiads, and of the Bucchantes, powerful enough to tear
¹¹P‚” &0·—l9. Ο Lenaee. ‘⁴ O God of the wine-press.’' The epithet
Lenaeus comes from the Greek Ληναῖος, which is itself a derivative from
Μὲἔςζ “a wine-press.”—-Mitscherlich well explains the concluding idea
of tiis ode, which lies couehcd under the figurative languagc employed
b the bai-d: “Ad argumentum carminis, si postrema transferas, erit:
gray'ectissimae quidem audaciae ese, Auyustum celebrare,- sed alea
jacta esto.”
