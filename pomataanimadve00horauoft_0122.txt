Classe cita reparavit oras :

quidlibet speraret.—ll. Fortunaque dulci ebria. “ And intoxicated
with prosperity.”—13. Sospes ab ignibus. “ saved from the flames.''
We have here somewhat of poetic exaggeration. Cleopatra fied with sixt
shi s, while three hundred were taken by Augustus. Many of Xntonyl?
vessels, however, were destroyed b ’ fise dun'ng the action—14. Lympha-
[am Mareotico. ⁶· Maddened with Marcotic wine.'' A bitter‚ though
not. strictly accurate, allusion to the luxurious habits of Cleopatra. The
poet pretends in this way to account for the* p‘a'n‘ic which seized her at
Actium—Mareotico. The Mareotic wine was produced along the bordei-s
of the Lake Mareotig, in Egypt. It was a light, sweetish‚ white wine‚with
a delicate perfume, of easy digestion. and not apt to affect the head, though
the allusion of Horace would seem to imply that it had not always pre-
served its innoeuous quality.

16—23. 16. Ab Italia volantem, δῖε. “ Pursuing her with swift
galleys, as she fied from Italy.” The expression ab Italia volantem is
to bc explained by the circumstance of Antony and Cleopatra's having
intended to make a desccnt upon Italy before Augustus should be
appriscd of their coming. Hence the ssight of Cleopatra, at the battle
of Actium, was in reality ab Italia—20. Haemoniae. Haemonia was
one of the earlv names of‘ Thessalv.--21. Fatale movisti-um. “ The
fated monster‚” ι. ε. the fated'szause of eqiLto the Roman world.—Quae.
A -zj‘llepsis, the relative-licing made to refer to the person indicated by
monstrum, not to the grammatical gender of the antecedent itself.- 23.
Expavit ensem. An allusion to the attempt which Cleopatra made upon
her own life, when Broculeius was sent by Augustus to secure her
persom—-IVec laxe—ntes, dcc. “ Nor soug'nt with a swift fleet for secret
shores.’' By latentes oras are meant coasts lyjng concealed from the
§wax of thc Romans. Plutarch states, that Cleopatra formed the design‚
after the battle at Actium, of drawing a fleet of vessels into the Arabian
Gulf, across the neck of land called at the present day the Isthmus of
Suez, and of secking some remote country, where she might neither be
reduced to slavery nor involved in wanajssThe >li-ingrapherradds, that the
first ships tmnsported across were burned bv the natives‘ of ‘Arabia Petraea, v
and that-Cleopatra subsequently abandoned the enterpris'e, res'o'sv‘ih‘g‘ffi* .
