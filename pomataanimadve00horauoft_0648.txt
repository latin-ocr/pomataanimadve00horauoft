Antiphaten, Scyllamque, et curn Cyclope Charybdin. κ 14⁵
N ec reditum Diomedis ab interitu Meleagri, ¹ Α
N ec gemino bellum Trojanun1 orditur ab ovo.
Semper ad eventum festinat, et in medias res,
Non secus ac notas, auditorem rapit, et quae
Desperat tractata nitescere posse, relinquit ; ⁴¹ 1-50
Atque ita mentitur, sie veris falsa remiscet,
Primo ne medium, medio ne discrepet imum.
Tu, quid ego et populus mecum desideret, audis
Si fautoris eges aulaea manentis, et usque

out of smoke to bring glorious light, and surprise us with the brilliant
and dazzling creations of his faney.—144. Speciosa miracula. “ His
brilliant wonders.'*—-145. Cyclope; alluding to Polyphemus—146,
Ne reditum Diomedis, ἃο. Horace does not mean by the “Return
of Diomede‚” any particular productiori of Homer's, but only wishffi
to give us a general idea of his manner of wrsting, and to show, that
he does not, like some droning cyclie poet, begin with events which
happened long before the main action of his poem, and have no
immediate or necessary connexion with it. Antimachus, a. cyclic hard,
had made a poem on the return of Diomede, and commenced the
adventures of that hero from the death of his uncle hleleager, by which
means he gave a ridiculous beginning to the aetion that formed the
subject of his u ork. So also ano her cy elic poet (supposed by some to
have been Stasinus of ijrus) began an account of the Trojan war
with the nativity of Helen, or the story of Leda and the egga—148.
In medias res. Horace means that Homer, at the outset of the Iliad,
does not delay us by a previous explanation of the causes which brought
on the angry strife between Achilles and Agamemnon, but commences
at once m'th an allusion to the wrath of Pelides, (Μῆνιν accessam)
as if the causes that led to it were already known to his beaten-150.
Tractata nitescere. A metaphor taken from things ⁴polished from the
force of handling. History, and a poet’s -imagination, ‘may furnish
him with a great variety of incidents, but his own judgment must direct
him in the choice os them. -151, Atque ita mentatur, sic veris salsa
remise-et, ἃς. ‘And moulds his fictions in such a way, so blends
what is false with w'hat is true,’&c.'11he meaning is, that Homer so
intermingles fiction with reahty, throughout the whole of nis poem, and
so strictly connects all the parts, as. to give the entire productiori an aix·>
of probability, and make thebeginning, middle, and end exactly corre«,

154-157. 154. Aulam manentis. “ Who will wait.until.the
curtain rises ;” i. c, who will wait until the end of the play 5> who*
will listen with delight to the whole performance3 literally, f‘who.
waits for the curtain.'’ We have rendered this phrase in accordance·
with Roman usage. If translated with reference, to modern custom, it
would be, “who will wait until the curtain falls.'’ Censuit note on
