Fratrem moerentis, rapto de fratre dolentis

Insol'abiliter ; tamen istuc mens animusque

Fert, et amat spatiis obstantia rumpere claustra.

Rure ego viventem, tu dicis in urbe beatum. Γ)
Cui placet alterius, sua nimirum est odio sors.

Stultus uterque lecum immeritum causatur inique;

In culpa est animus, qui se non effugit unquam.

Tu mediastinus tacita prece rura petebas,

Nunc urbem et ludos et balnea villicus optas. :5
Me constare mihi scis, et discedere tristem,

Quandocunque trahunt invisa negotia Romam.

Non eadem miramur ; eo disconvenit inter

Meque et te 3 riam, quae deserta et inhospita tesqua
Credis, amoena vocat mecum qui sentit, et odit *20

ι’. e. at Rome—8. Alens animusque; equivalent to totus meus animus.
When the Latin writers use mens animusque, they would express all the
faculties of the soul. Meus regards the superior and intelligent part 2
animus, the sensible and inferior, the source of the passions.—-9. Et
amat spatiis obstantia rumpere claustra. “ And long to break through
the barriers that oppose my way.” A figurative allusion to the carceres,
or barriers in the circus, (here called claustra,) where the chariots were
restrained until the signal given for starting3 as well as to the spatia,
or course itself. The plural form spatia is more frequently employed
«than the singular, in order to denote that it was run over several times
m one race. . ,

viventem—11. Sua nimirum est odio sors. “ His own lot evidently is an
unpleasing one.” The id'ea intended to be expressed by the whole line
is this: 'Tis a sure sign, when we enxw another's lot, that we are dis-
contented with our 0wn.—l‘2. Locum immeritum. Referring to the place
in which each one is either stationed at the time, or else passes his days.
-13. Qui se non effizyit unquam. Compare Ode 11. xvi. 20. “Patriae
quis exsul se quoque fuyit ,γ’-1 4. Mediastinus. “ While a mere drudge,
at every one’s beek.” [Mediastinus denotes a slave of the lowest rank,
one who was attached to no particular department of the household,
but was accustomed to perform the lowest offices‚ and to execute not only
any commands which the master might impose, but even those which
the other slaves belonging to particular stations might see fit to give.
Hence the derivation of the name from medius, as indicating one who
stands in the midst, exposed to the orders of a11.—15. Villicus; supply
factus.—l 6. Me constare mihi scis. It is very apparent from the satires,
and one in particular, (11. vii. 28.) that Horace was not always entitled
to the praise which he here bestows upon himself for consistency of
character. As he advanced in years, the resolutioris of the poet became
more fixed and settled—19. Tesqua. ‘⁴ Wilds.”-21. Uncta popina.
