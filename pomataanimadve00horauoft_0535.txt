EPISTOLA X.
AD FUSCUM ARISTIUM.

URBIS amatorem Fuscum salvere jubemus

Ruris amatores, hac in re scilicet una

Multum dissimiles, at cetera paene gemelli,

Fraternis animis, quidquid negat alter, ct alter ς

Annuimus pariter vetuli notique columbi. 5
Tu nidum servas, ego laudo ruris amoeni

Rivos‚ et musco circumlita saxa, nemusque.

Quid quaeris? vivo et regno, simul ista reliqui,

Quae vos ad coelum fertis rumore secundo ;

thue sacerdotis fugitivus, liba recuso ; 10

EmsrLE Χ .-—The poet lox ed to retire into the country, and indulge,
amid rural scenes, in reading, and m wooing his muse. Fuscus, on the
other hand, gave the preference to a city life, though· ln every thing else
his views aiid feeliugs were in unison with those of his friend. In the
present epistle, therefore, Horace states to his old companion the grounds
of his choice3 and paints, in masterly colouls, the innocent pleasureS‚ the
simplicity‚ and the calm repose of a country life.

1—10. 1. Urbis amatorem. Beautifully opposed to ruris amatores
in the following line—Fuscum salvere jubemus. “ Bid Fuscus hail?
Fuscus Aristius, who is here addressed, was a distinguished grammarian
and rhetorician of the day‚a man of probity, but too much influenced by
the desire of accumulating riches, the common vice of the times, and
preferring therefore a city life to the repose of the country. He is t-he
same individual to whom the 2·2d Ode of the first book is addressed.—
3. Paene gemelli. “ Almost twins.'' Compare Serm. Ι. iii. 44.—4. Et
alter. Supply neyat.—5. Ammimus pariter vetuli notique columbi.
“ We nod assent to each other, like old and constant doves.'’ Supply
veluti, or sicuti, and compare the explanatory remark of Doring: “Si
alter ait, alter quoque ait, alter alteri in omni re pari modo annuit.”—
Noti,· alluding literally to long acquaintance, and to constancy of attach-
ment resulting therefrom.—6. Nidzzm. The comparison is still kept
up, and the city, to which Fuscus clings‚ and in which all his desires

ι appear to·centre‚ is beautifully styled the nest, which he is said to keep,
while the poet roams abroad.—7. illusco circmnlz'ta saoea. “ The moss-
grown rocks.”—8. Quid quaeris ,2 “ In a word ;’' literally‚ “ what
wouldst thou have me say ,⁹ ’' This was a form of expression used when
they wanted, in few words, to give a reason for, or an explanation of,
any thing, and answers sanew11at to our phrase, ‘What can I say more θ’
