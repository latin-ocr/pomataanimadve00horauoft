ΙΝ superintending the publication of this Edition of Horace, Ι have
not felt myself warranted to make any alteration on the text, as given
by Professor Anthou, nor to mutilate, by the slightest omission, his
admirable “ Explanatory Notes.'’ On the contrary, 1 have taken the
liberty of inserting, among the preliminary matter, several additional
papers from the larger Work, which the learned Professor had
thought it advisable to omit in his Abridgment.

The Notes, which in the American edition were annexed to the
volume, have been thrown to the foot of their respective pages—au
arrangement more convenient, it is hoped, both for preceptor and
scholar. The Index of Proper Names has been partially enlarged,
and the quantities marked so far as was necessary for accuracy—of
pronunciation: and the whole Work, in its progress through the
press, has been revised with the greatest care.

The high estimation in which the talenta, scholarship, and critical
acumen of Dr. Anthou are held in the litei-try wornl, and his well-
earned celebrity as a classical editor, render any commendation of his
Works, and any apology for their reproduction amongst ourselves,

alike superfluous.
