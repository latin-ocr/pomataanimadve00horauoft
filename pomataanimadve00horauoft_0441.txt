SERMONUM Lrss. 11. 3. 399

Quid? quum balba feris annoso verba palato,

Aedificante casas qu‘i sanior? Adde cruorem 275

Stultitiae, atque ignem gladio scrutare modo, inquam.

Hellade percussa, Marius quum praecipitat se,

Cerritus fuit? an commotae crimine mentis

Absolves hominem, et sceleris damnabis eundem,

Ex more imponens cognata vocabula rebus? 230
Libertinus erat, qui circum compita siccus

Lautis mane senex manibus currebat, et, Unum,

thou in thy senses ? ”—274. Quum balba seris annoso verba palato. An
hypallage, for quum balbis verbis feris annosum palatum. The allusion
is now to some “ senex¹ amator.”—275. Aedificunte casas. Compare
note on verse ‘ML-Adde crtwrem stultitiae. “ To the folly of love add
the bloodshed which it osten occasions.”—·276. Atque iynem yladio εον-ιν
tare modo. “ And only stir the fire with a sword.” Not to stir the sire
with a sword, (πῦρ μαχαίρᾳ μὴ σκαλεύειν,) was a precept of Pythago·
ms ; by which the philosopher meant that we ought not to provoke a man
in a passion, or throw him into a more violent tage ; and farther, that a
man transported by passion ought not to give into every thing that his
rage dictates. Horace here applies this saying to the conduct of lovers,
whose passions osten carry them to murder-s, bloodshed, and all manner
of extravagance3 osten, too, their rage turns against themselves, as in
the case of Marius, mentioned immediately aster, who, in a fit of jealousy,
slew his mistress, and then in despair threw himself headlong from a
rock.—-277. Hellade percussa, illarius, &c Compare the scholiast:
‘⁴ Marius quidam ob amoris impatientiam Helladem puellam occidit, quod
ab ea contemneretur.”—278. Cerrz'tus suit? “ Was he out of his senses Ρ ”
-An commotae crimine mentis,&c. Every wicked man, observes Francis,
is a fool, for vice and folly are synonymous terms. But mankind endea-
vour to divide these ideas, thus nearly related, by giving to each of them,
at particular times, a different name ; as, when they would find Marius
guilty of murder, they would aequit him of madness. But the Stoic
condemns him of both, since, in his philosophy, murder and madness
are ‘⁴ kindred terms.'’ (Coynata vocabula.)

281—290. 281. Libertinus erat, qni circum, διο. The Stoic now ⁷
directs his attack against those who display their folly by secking for
things that are inconsistent with their condition, 01· by addressing vows
to the gods that are unreasonable and absusd. There is not a word
here, as Dacier well remarks, which does not aggravate the folly of this
conduct on the part of the freedman. He was old, senem, and should
have better known what prayer to make ; siccus, his folly was not an
effect of wine ; lautis manibus, he washed his hands with temper, and
a real spirit of religion 3 and yet he makes this extravagant petitiou,
only because the gods are able to grant it, not that it is in itselfjust and
reasonable—Compita. ln the compita, or places where two or more
roads met, Augustus ordered statues of the public Penates to be
erected, that public worship might be openly rendered to them by those
who passed loy-282. Unam, unum me surpite morti. ‘⁶ Save me, alone,
