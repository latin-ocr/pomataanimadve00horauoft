354 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Difficile et mirum, Rhodio quod Pitholeonti
Contigit 2—-At sermo linqua concinnus utraque
›Suam-ior, ut Chio noca εἰ cowmzz'xta Falerni est.

Quum versus facias, te ipsum percontor, an et quum 25
Dura tibi peragenda rei sit causa Petilli

Scilicet, oblitus patriaeque patrisque, Latine

Quum Pedius causas exsudet Publicola, atque

Corvinus 3 patriis intermiscere petita

Verba foris malis, Canusini more bilinguis? 30
Atqui ego quum Graecos facerem, natus mare citra,
Versiculos, vetuit tali me voce Quirinus,

Post mediam noctem visus, quum somnia vera :—

sisse, inquibus Graeca verba miaeta erant cnm Latinis.'’—23. Contigit.
To complete the sentence, understand sacc7·e.-—Atsermolin9ua concinnus,
διε. The admirer of Luci-lius replies to the bard: ‘¹ But a style ele-
gantly composed of both tongues is, on that very account, the more
pleasing3 as when Faleruian wine is mixed with Chian.⁷’ Nota Falerni
is here used for vinum Falernum, from the Roman eustom of markiug
their amphorae aud other wine vessels with the names of the consuls, in
order to designate the year when the wine was put in, aud ,consequently
mark its age.

25—30. 25. Quum versus facias, διο. At the beginning of this
sentence, supply the words Utrum tunc tantum. The poet here puts a
question to his antagonist, well calculated to expose the absurdity of the
remark which the latter has just made. Hc demands of him, whether he
intends to confine this mixed phraseology, which so strongly excites his
admiration, to the composition of verse merel-*¹3 ( utrum tunc tantum quum
versus facias ‚·) or whether he is to carry it with him into other fields of
exerfiun, to the pleadings of the bar, for example, and is to nse in tho
management of some important case, a jargon like that of the double·-
tongued Canusiau, while other advocates are striving tc· defend their
clients in a style marked by purity of language.-—‘.26. Petilli ‚· an allusion
to the story of Petillius Capitolinus. Consult note on Serm. 1. iv. 94.-27.
Patriaeque patrisque. ‘⁴ Of country and pareut;’' i. e. of thy native
tongue, and of the father who taught it thee.—Latineqzmm Pedius causas

exsudet Publicola, ἃς. “ While Pedius Publicola and Corvinus are plead- ,

ing their causes with elaborate care in the Latin tongue ;'' ἰ. e. strive, by

every means in their power, t0·prevent the admission of foreign words into
their oral style. Tho individuals herc alluded to were two distinguished
lawyers oi the day.—30. Canusini more bilinguis. ‘⁴ After the manner
of a double-tongucd Canusian.” The inhabitants of Canusium spoke a.
mixed dialect, made up of Oscan and Greek.

31—39. 31. Natus mare citra. “ Born on this side the water,” i. e.
in Italy, not in (hocca—32, Vetuit me. ‘⁶ Forbade me so to d0,'' i. e.
to write Greek verses. Horace is generally supposed to refer here to tho
period when he was pursuing his studies at Athens—Quirinus. Romulu-
is here selected, because naturally more interested than any other deity,
