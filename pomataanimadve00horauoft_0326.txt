286 Q. nonam FLACCI

At bona pars hominum, decepta cupidine falso,
Nil satis est, inquit3 quia tanti, quantum habeas, sis.
Quid facias illi? <lubeas miserum esse, libenter
Quatenus id facit. Ut quidam memoratur Athenis
Sordidus ac dives populi contemnere voces 65
Sic solitus : Populus nie sibilat, at mihi plaudo
Ipse domi, simul ac nummos contemplor in arca.—
Tantalus a labris sitiens fugientia captat
Flumina. Quid rides? mutato nomine de te
Fabula narratur: congestis undique saccis 70
Indormis inhians, et tanquam parcere sacris
Cogeris, aut pictis tanquam gaudere tabellis.
Nescis quo valeat nummus? quem praebeat usum?

that if any, despising the humble fountain‚ prefer to draw from the
stream of some large and impetuous river like the Aufidus, being
seized by its current, they will be swept away and perish amid the
watersg i. e. those who, not content with humble means, are continually
secking for more extensive possessions, will eventually suffer for their
foolish and insatiable cupidity.-As regards the Aufidus, consult note on
Ode 111. xxx. 10.

61—79. 61. At bona pars hominum, διο. After having proved by
unanswerable arguments, that riches, except we use them, have nothing
valuable, beautiful, or agreeable3 the poet here anticipates an objection,
which a miser might possibly make, that this love of money is only a
desire of reputation, since we are always esteemed in proportion to our
wealth. This objection might have some weight, for a love of public
esteem has virtue in it. But the miser falsely disguises his avarice
under the name of a more innocent passion, and wilfully mistakes.
(Decepta cupidine salso.)—62. Quia tanti, quantum habeas, sis.
“ Because thou wilt be esteemed in proportion to thy wealth.’'—63.
Quid facias illi? “ What wilt thou do with such a one as this 'P’—
64. Quatenus, “Since.''—-68. Tantalus a labris, &m The idea in-
tended to be conveyed is this: Thou who merely gazest on thy money
boarded up in thy coffers, without putting it to any use, or deriving any
benefit from it, art like Tantalus, who, tormented with thirst, catehes in
vain at the water that escapes from his lips. This is supposed to be. ad·
dressed by the poet, not to the miser with whom he has been reasoning,
but to the sordid Athenian whom he has just been picturing to the view.
On hearing the allusion to Tantalus, the miser bursts into a langii, and the
poet then turns upon him with the question Quid ‘rides Εἰ The miser
laugha at the poet’s citing what the prevalent scepticism of the day
regarded as one of a mere tissue of fables.—-69. Mutato nomine, διε.
“ The name changed, the story is told of thee.’' The traiu of ideas is
as follows: Dost thou laugh, and ask what Tantalus is to thee ἓ change
names with Tantalus, and thou wilt occupy his plaee; for, as he saw
the water before his eyes, and yet could not tante it, so thou gazest upon
thy money, but derivest no benefit from the accumulated hoard.··-7l.
