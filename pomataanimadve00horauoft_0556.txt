514 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Scribetur tibi forma loquaciter, et situs agri.
Continui montes, nisi dissocientur opaca 5
Valle3 sed ut veniens dextrum latus adspiciat Sol,
Laevum decedens curru fugiente vaporet.
Temperiem laudes. Quid, si rubicunda benigni
Corna vepres et pruna ferunt? si quercus et ilex
Multa fruge pecus, multa dominum juvat umbra? 10
Dicas adductum propius frondere Tarentum.
Fons etiam rivo dare nomen idoneus, ut nec
Frigidior Thracam nec purior ambiat Hebrus,
Infirmo capiti fluit utilis, utilis alvo.
Hae latebrae dulces, et jam, si credis, amoenae, 15
Incolumem tibi me praestant Septembribus horis. ⁷
Tu· recte vivis, si curas esse quod audis3

of training the vine along the trunk and branches of the elm.—4.
L-aqaaciter. “ In loquacious strain‚'’ i. e. at large. Compare the Greek
λαλιστὶ. The description, after all, is only ten lines; but the poet
perhaps felt that some indirect apology was required for again turning
to his favourite theme, although he intended to be brief in what he said.
-5. Continui montes, δίο. “ Α continued range of mountains, except
where they are parted by a shady vale ;*' i. e. imagine to thyself a con-
tinued chain of mountains, divided only by a shady vale. For the
grammatical construction we may supply hic sunt with montes, though
the translation is far neater if no verb be expressed. The poet is
pointing, as it were, to the surrounding scenery, and his friend is sup-
posed to be stationed by his side.—6. Sed ut veniens deoetrum latus, &c.
“So situated, however, that the approaching sun views its right side,
and warnis its lest when departing in his rapid car.'’—8. Temperiem.
Unde1·standa‘e'ris.—Si rubicunda benifflzz' corna, otc. “ If the very briers
produce in abundance the ruddy cornels and sloes.’'

10—17. 10. sslulta fruye. “ With plenty of acorns.''—Pecus;
equivalent here to sam-1 1. Dicas adductum propiusflondere Tarentum.
“ Thou wilt say that Tarentum blooms here, brought nearer to Rome ;''
τ’. e. tha* the delicious shades of Tarentum have changed their situation
and draw1 nearer to Rome—12. Fons etiam> rivo dare nomen idoneus.
‘⁶ A fountain, too, fit to give name to a stream ;‘' i. e. large enough to
form, and give name to, a stream. The stream here meant is the
Digentia, now Licenza: the other name for the fountain is the Fons
Bandusiae, now probably Fonte Bello. Compare Ode 111. 13.——Idoneus
«mre,- a Graecism for idoneus qui dea—14. Utilis. In the sense of
salubris.—16. Incolumem tibi me praestant. “ Preserve me in health
and safety for thee amid September hours ;’' τ’.. e. during the sickly
season of September.—l7. Tu recte vivis, si curas esse quod audis.
“ Thou leadest a happy life, if it is thy care to be what thou ait reputed.''
Audis is here equivalent to diceris. Horace, observes Francis, is here
very careless of the connexion. After having described his farm, he
