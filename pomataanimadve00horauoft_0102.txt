&2 Q. nonam FLACCI

Lenite clamorem, sodales,
Et cubito remanete presso.

ξιφίδιόν τι, τῷ μηρῷ προσηρτήμενον. This last comes nearest the true
explanation as given above. Compare Schneider, s. v. ἀκινάκης, ‘⁴ Ein
eigenthiimlich Persischcs lVort : ein kleiner Seitendegen bey den Persem.’⁷
-6. Immane quantum. Analagous to the Greek θαυμαστὸν ὅσον.-
Impz'um clamorem. The epithet impius has here a particular reference
to the violation of the ties and duties of friendship, as well as to the pro-
fanation of the table, which was always regarded as sacred by the ancientS.

8—9. 8. Cubita remanete presso. ‘⁴ Remain with the elbow pressed
on the couch‚’' τ’. e. stir not from your places; alluding to the ancient
custom of reclining at their meals.—9. Severi Falerni. All writers
agree in deseribing the Falernian wine as very strong and durable, and so
rough in its recent state, that it could not be drunk with pleasure‚but
required to be kept a. great number of years before it was suffieiently
mellow. Horace even terms it a “ fiery’' wine, and calls for water from
the spring· to moderate its strength, and Persius applies to it the epithet
“ indomitum,'' probably in allusion to its heady quality. From Galen’s
account, it appears to have been in best condition from the tenth to the
twentieth year3 afterwards, it was apt to contract an unpleasant bitter-
ness: yet we may suppose, that when of a good vintage, and especially
when preserved in glass bottlcs, it would keep much longer without
having its flavour impaired. Horace, who was a lover of old wine, pro—
poses, iu a well-known ode, (iii. 21.) to broach an amphora which was
co-eval with himself, and which, therefore, was probably not less than
thirty-three years old, as Torquatus Manlius was consul in the six hundred
and eighty-ninth year from the foundation of the city, and Corvinus, in
honour of whom the wine was to be drawn, did not obtain the consulate
till 723 A. U. C. As he bestows the highest commendatior» on this
sample, ascribing to it all the virtues of the choicest vintages, and pro· ¹
nouncing it truly worthy to be produced on a day of festivity, we must
believe it to have been really of excellent quality. In general, however, it
probably suffered more or less from the mode in which it was kept; and
those whose taste was not perverted by the rage for high-dried wines, pre»-
ferred it in its middle state.

Among our present wines, we have no hesitation in fixing upon those of
Xeres and Madeira as the two to which the Falernian offers the most dis-
tinct features of resemblance. Both are straw-coloured wines, assuming a
deeper tint from age, or from particular circumstances in the quality, or
management of the vintage. Both of them present the several varieties of
dry, sweet, and light. Both of them are exceedingly strong and durable
wincs; being, when new, very rough, harsh, and fiery, and requiring to be
kept about the same length of time as the Falernian before they attain a*
due degree of mellowness. Of the two, however, the more palpable dry-
ness and bitter-sweet flavour of the sherry might incline us to decide, that
it approached most nearly to the wine under consideratiou; >and it is
worthy of remark, that the same difference in the produce of the fermen-
tation is observable in the Xeres vintages, as that which Galen has noticed
with respect to the Falernian 3 it being impossible always to predict with
certainty whether the result will be a dry wine, or a sweetish wine, resem-
bling Paxaretc.
