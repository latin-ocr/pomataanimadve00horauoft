SERMONUM Lm. 1. 6. 329

Ut si qui aegrotet, quo morbo Barrus, haberi 30
Ut cupiat formosus ; eat quacunque, puellis

Injiciat curam quaerendi singula, quali

Sit facie, sura, quali pede, dente, capillo:

Sic qui promittit, cives, Urbem sibi curae,

Imperium fore, et Italiam et delubra deorum ; 35
Quo patre sit natus, num ignota matre inhonestus,

Omnes mortales curare et quaerere cogite-

the foot. Hence calceos mutare, “ to become a senator.’' (Cic. Phil.
xiii. 13.)—30. Ut sz' qui aegrotet, ἃς. ‘* Just as if one labour under
the same disorder that Barrus does, so as to desire to be thought a hand-
some man.’' As regards Barrus, consult note on Serm. 1. iv. 110...-
34. Sic qui promittit, &c.; an allusion to the form of the oath taken
by the magistrates when about to enter on the duties of their office.—
35. Imperium. ‘· The integrity of the empire.’'—36. Inlzonestus.
‘⁸ Dishonoured.’'—38. Tune Syri, Damae, διο. “ Darest thou, the son
of a Syrus, a Dama, or a Dionysius. hui-l Roman citizens down from
tho Taipeiau rock, or deliver them over to the executioner Cadmus? '¹
Syrus, Dama, and Dionysius, are the names of slaves, used here as
appellatives, and the meaning of the passage is, “ darest thou, the son of a
slave? διο. The poet supposes some individual of the people to be here
addressing a tribune of the commons, who had risen from the lowest origin
to that office of magistraey, by virtue of which he presided over the
execution of condemned malefactors.

40-44, 40. Αι Novius colleya, διο. The tribune is here supposed
to answer, and to urge in his defence‚ that his colleague Novius is of

him whether he fancies himself on that account a Paullus or a Messala?
—Gradu post me sedet uno. “ Sits one row behind me;'’ i. ε. is
inferior to mein rank, The reference is to the fourteen rows of seats
set apart for the Equestrian order at the public spectacles. The tribune
of the commons, to whom the poet here alludes, as well as his colleague
Novius, having obtained Equestrian rank in consequence of possessing
the requisito fortune, had seam, of course, among these fourteen rows. It
would seem, however, that, iu occupying these scats, those of better oxigin
always preceded those who were inferior to them iu this respect.—4l.
IVamque est ille, διο, “ For he is what my father was ; '² i. e. he is a
freedman, whereas I ain the son of a sreedman, and consequently one
degree his superior.-Hoc tibi Paullus, &c. “ Dost thou fancy thyself.
on this account, a Paullus and a Messala?” Aemilius Paullus and
Messala Corvinus were two distinguished noblemen of the day, and the
question here put is equivalent to this: Dost thou fancy to thyself, that,
