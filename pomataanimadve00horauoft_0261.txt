CARMINUM Lm. lv. 12. 221

Dicunt in tenero gramine pinguium
Custodes ovium carmina fistula, 10
Delectantque deum, cui pecus et nigrae

Colles Arcadiae placent.

Adduxere sitim tempora, Virgili:

Sed pressum Calibus ducere Liberum

Si gestis, juvenum nobilium cliens, 15
Nardo vina mereberis.

Nardi parvus onyx eliciet eadum,
Qui nune Sulpiciis accubat horreis
Spes donare novas largus, amaraque
Curatum eluere efficax. 20

blow more steadily at this season of the year.—4. Hiberna nive. “ By
the melting of the winter snow.”—6. Infelix· avis. The reference is
here to the nightingale‚ and not to the swallow. Horace evidently alludes
to that version of the story which makes Progne to have been changed into
a nightingale and Philomela into a mahom—Ec Cecropiae domus, ἃς.
“ And the eterual reproach of the Attic line, sor having too cruelly re-
venged the brutal lusts of kings.'' Cecropiae is here equivalent simply
to Atticae, as Pandion, the father of Progne, though king of Athens, was
not a. descendant of Cecrops.--ll. Deum ,· alluding to Pan.—N2'9rae
colles. “ The dark hills,'' i. e. gloomy with forests. Among the hilis,
or, more properly speaking, mountains of Arcadia, the poets assigned
Lycaeus and Maenalus to Pau as his favourite retreats.—13. Adduoeere
sitim tempora. “ The season of the year brings along with it thirst ;”
i. e. the heats of Spring, and the thirst produced by them, impel us to the
wine-cup.—l4. Pressum Calibus Liberum. “ The wine pressed at
Cales.” Consult note on Ode 1. xx. 9.-15. Juvenum nobilium cliens.
Who the “juvenes nobiles '’ were, to whom the poet here alludes, it is
impossible to say; neither is it a matter of the least importance. Those
commentators who maintain that the ode is addressed to the hard of Mau-
tun, make them to be the young Neres, Drusus and Til›erius·‚ and Dor-ing,
who is one of the number that advocate this opinion relative to Virgil, regards
cliens as equivalent to the German ‘⁴ Giinstliny,” ⁴⁴ savourite.”—16.
Nardo vina mereberis. “Thou shalt carn thy wine with spikenard.''
Horace, as we have already stated in the Introductory Remarks, invites
the individua, whom he here addresses, to an intertainment, where each
guest is to contribute his quota. Our poet agrees to furuish the wine, if
virgil will supply perfumes, and hence tells him ho shall have wine for his
spikenard.—l7. Parvus onyx. ‘¹ A small alabaster box.’'——Elz'ciet
cadum. ‘¹ Will draw forth a cask ;'' i. e. will cause me to furnish a cask
of wine for the entertainment. The opposition between parvus onya* and
cadus is worthy of notice.—18. Qui nunc Sulpiciis, &c. “ Which now
lies stored away in the Sulpician repositories.’' Consult note on Ode ιιι.
xx. 7. According to Porphyrion in his scholia on this passage, the poet
alludes to a certain Sulpicius Galba, a well known merchant of the day.-
