CARMEN XXVIII.

NAUTA ET ARCHYTAE UMBRA.
NAUTA.

ΤΕ maris et terrae numeroque carentis arenae
Mensorem cohibent, Archffia,

Onr: XXVIII.—The object of the present ode is to enforce the useful
lesson, that we are all subject to the power of death, whatever may be
our station in hfe, and whatever our talents and acquirements. The
dialogue form is adopted for this purpose, and the parties introduced are
a mariner and the shade of Archytas. ἷξε former, as he is travelling
along the shore of souther‘ndgaly, discovers the dead body of the philo-
sopher, which had been thrown up by the waves near t—he—thnzf Mati-
ω on the Tarentine Gulf. He⁴ addresses the corpse, and expresses
his surprise that so illustrious an individual could not escape from the
dominion of the grave. At the seventh verse the shade replies‚ and con-
tinues on until the end of the ode—Be not surprised, O mariner, at
beholding mein this state, exclaims the fallmQhagoman, Death hath
selected far nobler victims: bestow the last sad offices on my remains,
and so shall prosperous fortune crown your every effort; if, on the con-
trary, you make light of my request‚ expect not to escape ajust retribution.

The ode would appear, from its general complexion, to have been
imitated from the Greek.

 

 

1. Te maris et terrae, ἃς. The order of construction is as follows :
Parva munera eoeiyui pulveris (negata tibi) cohibent te, ἃς. “ The
scanty present of a little dust, denied to thy remains, confines thee‚’' &c.
The ellipsis of neyata tibi must be noted, though required more by the
idiom of our own, than by that of the Latin tongue. According to the
popular belief, if a corpse were deprived of the rites of sepulture, the shade
of the deceased was compelled to wander for a hundred years either around
the dead body, or along the banks of the Styx. Hence the peculiar pro-
priety of cohibent in the present passage. Iu order to obviate so lament-
able a result, it was esteemed a most solemn duty for every one who
chanced to encounter an unburied corpse, to perform the last sad officee to
it. Sprinkling dust or saud three times upon the dead body, was esteemed
amply sufficient for every purpose. Hence the language of the text,
‘¹ pulveris exigui parva munera.'’ Whoever neglected this injunction
of religion was compelled to expiate his crime by sacrificing a sow to
Ceres. Compare Festus (in Pmecidanea aqna), Cicero, de Leyibus,
ii. 22; Marius Victorinus, i. p. 247 ed Putsch.

'the interpretation which we have here given has found, however, very
strenuous opponents. Mitscherlich, Jani, and Doring maintain, that
pulveris eoeiyui parva munera is a mere circumlocutlon for locus eoeiyuus,
and that cohibent is only the compound used for the simple verb. Hence,
according to these commentators, the meaning will be, ‘⁴ A small spot ot
carth now holds thee,'' διε. ; and they conten& that in this way the oppo-
sitien is best preserved between the different parts of the sentence. We
