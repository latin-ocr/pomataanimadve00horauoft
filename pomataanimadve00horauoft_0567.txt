Lacrima,· per sanctum juratus dicat Osirin, SC
Credite, ‘non ludo ; crudeles, tollite claudum !—

EPIsToLA XVIII.
AD LOLLIUM.

S1 bene te novi, metues, liberrime Lolli,
Scurrantis speciem praebere, professus amicum.
Ut matrona meretrici dispar erit atque
Discolor, infido scurrae distabit amicus.
Est huic diversum vitio vitium prope majuS, 5
Asperitas agrestis et inconcinna gravisque,
Quae se commendat tonsa cute, dentibus atris,
Dum vult libertas diei mera, veraque virtus.
Virtus est medium vitiorum, et utrinque reductum.
Alter in obsequium plus aequo pronus, et imi 10

with his leg actually broken.'’ Planus is of Greek origin (πλάνος).
Decimus Laberius first Latinized‚ and Aulus Gellius blames the boldness

at Rome by the lower orders3 and hence the wandering beggar here

speciem praebere, ἃς. “ To display the character of a sordid flatterer,

scholiast: ‘⁴ Scurrantis 3 turpiter· adulantis.'’—3. Ut matrona meren-ici
dispar eritatque discolor, &c ‘⁵ As a matron will differ from a courtezan
both in sentiment and in appearance, so will a friend be unlike a faith-

the sentence-5. Huic viti05 alluding to base and sordid flattery.—
6. Asperitas agrestis et inconcinna gravisque. “ A clownish and unman—
nerly and offensive rudencss.”—-7. Tonsa cute. ‘⁶ By being shorn to
