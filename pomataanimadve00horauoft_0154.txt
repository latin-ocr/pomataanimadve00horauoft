114 Q. HORATI'I FLACCI

CARMEN XVI.
AD GROSPHUM.

OTIUM divos rogat impotenti

Pressus Aegaeo, simul atra nubes

Condidit Lunam, neque certa fulgent
Sidera nautis :

Otium bello furiosa Thrace, 5
Otium Medi pharetra decori,
Grosphe, non gemmis neque purpura, ve-

nale neque auro.

Non enim gazae neque consularis
Summovet lictor miseros tumultus 10
Mentis, et Curas laqueata circum

Tecta volantes.

“ Nor did the laws, while they ordered them to adorn their towns at the
public charge, and the temples of the gods with new stone, permit them
(in rearing their simple abodes‘) to reject the turf which cliance might
have thrown in their way.'’ The meaning of the poet is simply this:
Private abodes iu those days were plain and unexpensive 2 the only orna-
mental structures were such as were erected for the purposes of the state
or the worship of the gods.-20. Noco saoeo. The epithet novo merely
refers to the circumstance os stone being in that early age a new (i. e. un-
usual) material for private abmles, and appropriated solely to edifices of a
public nature.

One XV1.—A11 men are anxious for a life of repose, but all do not pnr-
sue the true path for attaining this 'desirablc end. It is to be foundneither
in the possession of riches, nor in the enjoyinent of public honours. The
contented man is alone successful in the search, and the more so from his
constantly remembering that perfect happiness is nowhere to be found on
earth.—Such is a faint outline of this beautiful ode, and which proves, we
trust, how totally unfounded is the critic-ism of Lord Kaimes, (Elements,

vol. i. p. 37,) with reference to what he is pleased to consider its want of
connexmn.
