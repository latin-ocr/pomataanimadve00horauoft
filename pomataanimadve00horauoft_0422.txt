380 Q. HORATII FLACCI.

Culpantur frustra calami, immeritusque laborat
Iratis natus paries d'is atque poetis,
Atqui vultus erat multa et praeclara minantis,
Si vacuum tepido cepisset villula tecto. 10
Quorsum pertinuit stipare Platona Menandro ἲ
Eupolin Archilocho, comites educere tantos?
Invidiam placare paras, virtute relicta?
Contemnere miser. Vitanda est improba Siren
Desidia3 aut quidquid vita meliore parasti, 15
Ponendum aequo animo.

HORATIUS.

Di te, Damasippe, deaeque

Verum ob consilium donent tonsore. Sed unde
Tam bene me nosti?

length, tired with waiting to no purpose, he exclaims,Nz'l est. “ Nothing
is forthcoming.⁷'——7. Calami. ‘⁴ The pens.” When writing on paper

or parchment, the Romans made use of a reed sharpened and split in the >

point, like our pens, which they dipped in ink ( atramentum ).—I mme-
ritusque laborat iratis natus paries, δίο. “And the unoffending wall
suffers, born under the malediction of gods and of poets.'' A humour-
ous allusion. The walls of a poet's chamber, observes Francis, seem
built with the curse of the gods upon them, since the gods have sub-
jected them to the caprieious passions of the rhyming tribe, who curse
and strike thern in their poetical fits, as if they were the cause of their
sterility.

9—16. 9. Atqui vultus erat, &c. ‘⁶ And yet thou hadst the air of
one that threatened many fine things, if once thy little villa should
receive thee, disengaged from other pursuits, beneath its comfomable
roof.''-]‡1inantis. Compare the scholiast: pollicentis, promittentis. The
allusion is to the promised results of the poet's labours.—lO. Vacuwm.
Supply the ellipsis as follows: te vacuum rerum.—Tepido; alluding to
the comfortable accommodations at the poet‘s Sabine villa—ll. Quor-
sum pertinuit stipare, διο. “ What good purpose has it answered to
pack Plato on Menander, Eupolis on Archilochus Ρ ” The 0allusion is
to the works of these writers, which the poet is supposed to have packed
up and brought with him into the country.-—l3. Invidiam placare paras,
virtute relicta? “ A1t thou attempting to allay the odium excited
against thee, by abandoning the path of virtue Ρ ” i. e. art thou endea-
vouring to allay the odium excited by thy satirical writings‚ by abandon-
ing altogether that branch of composition? The writing of satires is
here djgm'fled with the appellation of “ virtus,” its object being to lash
the vices and the failings of mem-15. Quidquid. Understand laudis.
—Vzta meliore. “ In the better period of thy life ;'' in those better
days, when spiritless and indolent feelings had not as yet come upon
thee, and when thou wert wont to lash with seven'ty the failings of men.

—16. Ponendum. “ Must be given up.”
