SERMONUM Lm. 11. 3. 391

Non est perjurus neque sordidus: immolet aequis

Hic porcum Laribus ; verum ambitiosus et audax ε 165
Naviget Anticyram. Quidenim differt, barathrone

Dones quidquid habes, an nunquam utare paratis?

Servius Oppidius Canusi duo praedia, dives

Fertur, et haec moriens pueris dixisse vocatis 170
Ad lectum: Postquam te talos, Aule, nucesque

Ferre sinu lez-vo, donare et ludere eidi,

Te, Tiberi, numerare, cacis abscondere tristem .-

Quare per divos oratus uterque Ponam,

Tu cave ne minuas, tu, ne majasfizcias id,

Quod satis esse putat pater, ot natura coercet.

164. Aequis. In the sense of Propitiis—165. Porcum. As all the good
and bad accidents that happened in families were generally attributed
to the household deities, Stertinius advises the man who, by the favour
of these gods, is neither perjured nor a miser, gratefully to sacrifice a
hog to them, which was their usual oblation.—166. Naviget Anticyram.
Compare note on verse 83. The expression naviyet Anticyram (or
Anticyras) is one of a proverbial character, and equivalent to “insanus
est.”-Barathro. “ On the greedy and all-devouring gulf of the popu-
lace.'' The populace, constantly demanding new gratifications from the
candidates for their favour, and never satiated‚ ase here forcibly com—
pared to a deep pit or gulf, into which many things may be thrown, and
yet no perceptible diminution in depth present itself.

161—178. 168. Dives antiquo censu. “ Rich according to the
estimate of former times ;” i. e. who in the earlier and simpler periods
of the Roman state, when riches were less abundant, would have been
regarded as a wealthy mam—Divisae. Contracted from divisisse.—17l.
Talos nucesqzae. “Thy tali and nuts‚''‘ i. e. thy playthings. The tale:
here meant were a kind of bones, with which children used to play.

172—186. 172. Sina [ατο. “ In the bosom of thy gown lest care-
lessly open.” Aulus carried about his playthings in the bosom or
sinus of his praeteoeta, which he allowed to hang in a loose and careless
manner about him. The anxious father saw in this, and in what imme·-
diately follows, (donare et ludere, ) the seeds, as he feared, of prodigality
in aster-life.—Donare et ludere. “ Give them away to others, and lose
them at play. '³ — 173. Tristem. “ With an anxious brow. '³ —-
174. Vesania discors. ‘⁴ Different kinds of madness ;'' i. e. the father
feared lest Aulus should become a prodigal, and Tiberius a miser.—
175. Nomentanum. Consult note on Sat. 1. i. lOl.—C'icutam. Com-
pare note on verse 69.-178. Co'c‘rcet. ‘⁶ Assigns as a limit,” i. e. deem‘:
