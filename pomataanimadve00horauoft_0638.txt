59 4 Q. HORATH FLACGI

In verbis etiam tenuis cautusque serendis, 4³
Hoc amet, hoc spernat promissi carminis aucton·
Dixeris egregie, notum si callida verbum
Reddiderit junctura novum. Si forte necesse est
Indiciis monstrare recentibus abdita rerum,
Fingere cinctutis non exaudita Cethegis 50
Continget, dabiturque licentia sumta pudenter.

disposition ofhis subject ; and he adds these wordS, ant egofallor, from
a principle of modesty, because he was going to establish a new pre-
cent, upon the practice of the greatest authors of antiquity‚ and one
that had never been mentioned by any writer before him,-45. In
verbis etiam tennis cautusque serendis. “ Nice and-cautious too in the
em plovment of words.'‘ The same causes will equally affect thelanguage
as the inethod of poetry. To the general reflections, therefore, on poetic
distribution, in which Horace has thus far indulged, are now properly
subjoined some directions about the use ff words. 46. Hoc amet, hoe
spernat promissi carminis auctor. According to the arrangement in
the common editions, this verse and the one immediately preceding are
transposed. The propriety, however, of Bentley’s position of these
lines, which we have followed in our text, all must allow. Gesner
observes in its favour, that it was customary with the copyists‚ when a
line was misplaced by them . to denote such misplacing by very minute
marks, which might easily become obliterated in the lapse oftime. To
the same effect are the words of Easte (Comment. Pateogr. p. 858).
The expression in the text, hoc amet, hoc spernat, is equivalent to
aliud verbnm amplectatur, aliud rejiciaL.—47. Callidajunctura. “ Some
skilful arrangement.'' ‹June-tura, observes Hurd, as here employed
by the poet, is a word ot* large and general import, and the same in
expression as order or disposition in a subject. The poet would say,
“instead ot framing new words. I recommend to you any kind of
artful management by which you may be able to give a new air and
ca==t to old ones.''

49-52. 49. Iudiciis monstrare recentibus abdita rerum. “To ex·
plain some abstruse subjects by newly-invented terms.’' The allusion
in abdita rerum is to things hitherto [ving concealed, and now for the
first time brought to light3 i. e. inventronsand discoveries‚ which need
of course newly-invented tex-ms to enable others to comprehend them.
—50. Fingere cinctutis non exaudita Cethegis continget. “It will be
allowed to eoin words uuheard of by the ancient Cethegi.'' The
Cethegi are here put for the ancient Romans generally, and Horace,

, in full accordance with his subject, and the better to mark their

antiquity⁷ makes use of an old term cinctutis. This epithet cinctutus
properly means “ girded ready for acting‚’' and marks the habits ofthe
early Romans. It has a special reference to the Gabine cincture, which
was so called when the lappet of the gown‚ that used to be thrown over
the left shoulder‚ was passed around the back in such a manner as to
come short to the breast aud there fasten in a knot3 this knot οι· cinc-
ture tucked up the grown, aud made it shorter and straiter‚ and conse-
quently better adapted for active employment.—-5l. Sumta pudenter.
