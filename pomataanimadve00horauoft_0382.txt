342 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Hoc miserae plebi stabat commune sepulerum, 10
Pantolabo scurrae Nomentanoque nepoti.

Mille pedes in fronte, trecentos cippus in agrum

Hic dabat3 heredes monumentum ne sequeretur.

Nune lieet Esquiliis habitare salubribus, atque

Aggere in aprico spatiari, qua modo tristes 15
Albis informem spectabant ossibus agrum,

Quantum carminibus quae versant atque venenis

As regards Pantolabus, the scholiast tells us his true name'was Mallius
Verria, aud that he received the appellation of Pantolabus from his habit of
indiscriminate bari-owing. With respect to Nomentanus, consult note on
Serm. 1. i. 101.

should not descend to the hcirs of the estate? It was the eustom, when
ground was set apart by any individual‚ as in the present instance, for a
place of intermeat, to creet upon it a small square pillar of stone, with

an inscription ou it, designating the limits of the piece of land to be η

appropriated for this purpose, and declaring that it never was to return to
