Ut, quantum generi demas, virtutibus addas.
Me primis Urbis belli placuisse domique,
Corpo'ris exigui, praecanum, solibus aptum,
Irasci celerem, tamen ut placabilis essem.
Forte meum si quis te percontabitur aevum,
Me quater undenos sciat implevisse Decembres,

consulship of L. Aurelius Cotta and L. Manlius Torquatus. From this
period to the consulship of M. Lollius and Q. [Emilius Lepidus there
was an interval of forty-four years—28. Collegam Lepidum quo duxit
Lollius anno. “In the year that Lollius received Lapidus as a col-
league.'' The verb eluxit, as here employed, has a particular reference
to the fact of Lollius having been elected consul previous to Lepidus
being chosen. According to Dio Cassius (54. 6), Augustus being, in
the year 733, in Sicily, the consulship was given to him and Lollius.
Augustus, however, declined this office, and therefore Q. AEmilius
Lepidus and L. Silanus became candidates for the vacant place. Aster

then, Lollius may be said to have received him into the consulship ;
