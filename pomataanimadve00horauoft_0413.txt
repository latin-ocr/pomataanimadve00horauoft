31-34, 31. Unde datam sentis. For unde tibi concessum est ut
sentias. “ Whence is it given thee to perceive ,ω’ i. e. by what means
art thou able to discover? The scholiast alludes to this nicety of taste
on the part of the Roman epicurea, by which they pretended to bc able
to tell whether a fish had been taken between the Mulvian and Sublician
1›ridge2‚ or at the mouth of the Tiber. In the former case, the fish was
thought to have a better taste, as having been caught in more rapid
waten—Lupus. The pike. The Perea labraoe of modern ichthyology.

sse poet now passes to another piece of folly in the your-mancis of the
day, by whom the rarer the food the more highly is it esteemed, and
the more eagerly sought aster, while other viands, of equal flavour in every
respect, are despised, because they are common and easy to be procured.
Thus, the case of the mullet and pike is cited, the former a small, the
latter a long fish. lf the mullet, which seldom exceeded two pounds,
according to Pliny, (Hist. Nat. ix. 17.) even when kept in the vivaria and
piscinoe of the rich, could only be procured of three pounds' weight, it
was esteemed one of the greatest of raritics, while the pike, though
weighing many pounds, was thought to be far its inferior.--34. M allum.
Horace here alludes to a three-pound mullet as a prize of rare occurrence.
-In sitzyula quem minuas pulmenta necesse est. “Which thou art
compelled to cut into small bits.” The ⁴allusion is to the small pieces
into which the fish must be divided, in order that each of the guests may
have a share.

(if the line be genuine) 'raro must be joined with jejunus, and the allu-
sion is to the stomach of the rich, which is here described as “ rarely
hungry.” This therefore is the reason, according to Ofellus and the
poet, why the stomach of the rich contemns common food, and gives the
preference to the small mullet over the large pike.-39. ,Magnana
