142 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Sub rege Medo, Marsus et Appulus!
Anciliorum et nominis et togae ‹ge- 20
Oblitus, aeternaeque Vestae,
Incolumi Jove et urbe Roma?

Hoc caverat mens provida Reguli,
Dissentientis conditionibus
Foedis, et exemplo trahenti 16
Perniciem veniens in aevum,

Si non perirent immiserabilis
Captiva pubes. “ Signa ego Punicis
Affixa delubris, et arma
Militibus sine caede,” dixit, 20
‘⁶ Derepta vidi: vidi ego civium
Retorta tergo brachia libero,
Portasque non clusas, et arva
Marte coli populata nostro.

Appulus. The Marsians and Apulians, the bravest portion of the Roman
armies, are here taken to denote the Roman soldiers generally. —10. Anci-
liorum. The ancilza were “the sacred shields” carried round in pro-
cession by the Salii or priests of Mais—Et nominis et toyae. “And
of the name and attire of a Roman.” The toya was the distinguishing
part of the Roman dress, and the badge of a citizen.—-11. Aeternaeque
Vestae. Alluding to the sacred fire kept constantly burning by the
Vestal virgins in the temple of the goddess.-12'. Incolumi Jove et urbe
Roma. ‘⁴ The Capitol and the Roman city being safe,²’ i. e. though the
Roman power remained still superior to its foes. Jove is here put sor
Jove Capitolino, equivalent in fact to Capitolio.

13—38. 13. Hoc caverat, διο. The example of Regulus is now
cited, who foresaw the evil effects that would result to his country, if the
Roman soldier was aliowed ‘t'o ‘place his hopes of safety anywhere but m
arms. Hence the vanquished commander recommends to his country-
men not to accept the terms offe1ed by the Carthagiuians, and, by
receiving back the Roman captives, establish a precedent pregnaut with
ruin to a future age. The soldier must either conquer or die3 he must
not expect that, by becoming a captive, he will have a chance of being
ransomed‚ and thus restored to his country. -14, Dissentientis eondi-
tionibus, ἃς. “ Abhoning the foul terms proposed by Carthago, 1and a
precedent pregnant with ruin to a future age;'' alluding to the terms of
accommodatiou of ulrich he himself was the bearer, and which he
advised his country-men to reject. The Carthaginians wished peace and
a mutual ransoming of prisoners. —17. Si non perirent, διε. ‘ If the
captive youth were not to perish unlamentedss' QcssfflmQEALeQ-Qgis
periret, which inJures the metre.-20.M1letzbus “ From our soldieryfl’

“ -23, Portasque non clusas, &c. ‘⁶ And the gates of the foe standing
