Pomifer Auetumnus fruges effuderit : et mox
Bruma recurrit iners.

Damna tamen celeres reparant coelestia lunae:
Nos, ubi decidimus,

Quo pius Aeneas, quo dives Tullus et Ancus, 1χό
Pulvis et umbra sumus.

the verb deciderunt.—-Dives Tullus et Ancus. The epithet dives alludes

since Claudiam (XV. 109‚) when comparing Rome under Ancus with the
same city under the emperor, speaks of the ‘¹ moenia pauperis Anci.’'—
