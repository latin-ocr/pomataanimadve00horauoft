EPISTLES.

*-

11 has been frequently discussed, whether the Epistles of Horace should
be considered as a continuation of his Satires Ρ 01, if they be not a
sequel to them, what forms the difference between these two sorts of
composition? Casaubon has maintained, that the Satires and Epis-
tles were originally compriscd under the general name of Sermones,· but
that, in the poems to which critics subsequently gave the name of
satires, Horace has attempted to extirpate prejudices, and, in the epis-
tles, to inculcate Iessons of virtue, so that the two works, united, form a
complete course of morals. This opinion has been adopted by Dacier,
Wieland, and many other critics. Some commentators, however, have
found, that the satires and epistles have so many other distinctive cha-
racteristics that they cannot be classed together. An epistle, they main-
tain, is necessarily addressed to an individual, not merely in 'the form of
a dedication, but in such a manner that his character, and the circum—
stances under which it is inscribed to him, essentially affect the subject
of the poem. The legitimate object of satire is to brand vice or chastise
folly3 but the epistle has no fixed or determinate scope. It may be
satirical3 but it may, with equa] propriety, be complimentary or critical.
Add to this, that the satire may, and 111 the hands of Horace frequently
does, assume a dramatic shape ; but the epistle cannot receive it, the
epistolary form being essential to its existence.

The epistles of Horace were written by him at a more advanced
period of life than his satires, and were the last fruits of 1115 long expe-
rience. Accordingly, we find in them more matured wisdom, more
sound judgment, mildness, and philosophy, more of his own internal feel-
ings, and greater skill and perfection in the versification. The chief
merit, however, of the epistles depends on the variety in the characters
of the persons to whom they are addressed ; and in conformity with
which, the poet changes his tone and diversifies his colouring. They
have not the generality of some modern epistles, which are merely
inscribed with the name of a friend, and may have been composed for the -
whole human race ; nor of some ancient Idyls, where we are solely
reminded of an individua} by superfluous invocations of his name. Each
epistle is written expressly for the entertainment, instruction, or reforma-
tion of him to whom it is addressed. The poet enters into his situation
with wonderful facility, and every word has a reference, more or less
remote, to his circumstances, feelings, or prejudices. In his satires, the
