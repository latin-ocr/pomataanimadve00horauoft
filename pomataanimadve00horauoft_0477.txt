Externi ne quid valeat per leve morari,
In quem manca ruit semper Fortuna. Potesne
Ex his ut proprium quid noscere? Quinque talenta
Poscit te mulier, vexat, foribusque repulsum 90
Perfundit gelida ; rursus vocat: eripe turpi
Colla jugo: Liber, liber sum, dic age. Non quis:
Urguet enim dominus mentem non lenis, et acres
Subjectat lasso stimulos, versatque negantem.
Vel quum Pausiaca torpes, insane, tabella, 95
Qui peccas minus atque ego, quum Fulvi Rutubaeque
Aut Placideiani contento poplite miror
Proelia, rubrica picta aut carbone: velut si
Re vera pugnent, feriant, vitentque moventes
Arma viri? Nequam et cessator Davum at ipsc 102]

man, in every condition, is happy in the possession of a mind accom-
modated to nature, and all external things are conscqucntly indifferent.
—Teres atque rotundus. ‘⁶ Smooth and round.” The metaphor is taken
from a globe. Our defects are so many inequalities and roughnesses‚
which wisdom polishes and rubs off. The image, too, suits extremely
well with the other part of the description, in se ipso cotue-87. Eoeterni
ne quid valeat, &a “ So that no extemal substance can adhere to the
suriace, by reason of the polish which it possesses‚·’' i. e. so that no
moral defilement can attach itself where there is nothing congenial to
receive it.—88. Manca. “With feeble power.”—Poeesne em his ut pro-
prium quid noscere? “ Canst thou, out of all these qmlities, recognise
any one that belongs peculiarly to thee ,ν’-90. Veram equivalent to
contumeliose tractat.—91. Gelida. Understand aqua—92. Non quis.
“Thou canst n‹)t.'' Quis from quea—93. Dominus non lenis. ⁴⁶ An
unreleuting master,” i. e. the tyrant-sway of thy piissimis—94. Ver-satque
neyantem. “And urges thee on, though strix-ing to resist ;” equivalent
vo-repuynantem itu-ilat.

95—100. 95. Pausiaca torpes tabella. “Art lost in stupid admira-
tion of a picture by Pausias.'' Pausias was a Greek painter, a native of
Sicyon, and flourished about 360 B. C.—-96. Qui peccas minus atque
eyo, διο. “How art thou less dcserving of blame than I ?''——Fulv5,
Rutubaeque, aut Placiclez‘am', ἃς. Fulvius, Rutuba, and Placideianus,
were three famous gladiator-s of the day ; and the allusion in the text is
to the delineations of gladiatorial combats, which were put up in public,
and were intended to announce the coming sports, being analogous in
this respect to our modern show-bilis. These representations were in
general rudely drawn3 sometimes, however, much skill was displayed
in their execution.-97. Contenta poplite. ‘⁶ With the sinews of the
ham strongly stretched.’' This is intended to represent the posture of
a gladiator, when facing his antagonist, testing firmly on one leg,
and having the other thrown out in advance, ‘⁴ contento poplite.”-·-10⁰.
