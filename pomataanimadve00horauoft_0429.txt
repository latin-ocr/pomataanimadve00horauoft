Virtus, fama, decus, divina humanaque pulchris 95

Clarus erit, fortis, justus· Sapiensne? Etiam,· et rex,
Et quidquid volet. Hoc, veluti virtute paratum,

In media jussit Libya, quia tardius irent
Propter onus segnes? Uter est insanior horum?
Nil agit exemplum, litem quod lite resolvit.
Si quis emat citharas, emtas comportet in unum,

common form visus esset.—98. IIoc‚· alluding to his accumulated riches;
and in this we see the reason for the injunction which Staberius laid upon
his heirs. As he himself thought every thing of wealth, he conceived
that posterity would adopt the same standard of excellence, and enter-
tain the higher opinion of him, the greater they saw the sum to be which
he had amassed during his life, and lest by testament to his heim—99.
Quid simile isli Graecus A rislippus. ‘⁶ What did the Grecian Aristippus
do like this man ?” i. e. how unlike to this was the conductos the Grecian
Aristippus. The philosopher here named was founder of the Cyrenaie
sect, which derived his name from his native city, Cyrene in Africa.
Pleasure, according to him, is the ultimate object of human pursuit3 and
it is only in subserviency to this, that fame, friendship, and even virtue,
are to be desired. Since pleasure then, argued our philosopher, is to be
derived, not from the past or the future, but the present, a wise man will
take care to enjoy the present hour, and will be indifferent to life or
death. His doctrine was, of course, much decried by the Stoics‚ and
Stertinius, who was himself a Stoic, has given an ill-natured turn to this
story.—lO3. Nil ayit eaeemplum, litem quod lite resolvit. “ An instance,
which solves one difficulty by raising another, concludes, thou wilt say,
nothing.'' Stertinius here anticipates an‘ objection that might be urged
against his mode of reasoning‚ and in so doing indulges his feelings of
opposition to the doctrines of Aristippus. The excessive regard for
wealth which characterized Staberius cannot be censured by addueing
the opposite example of Aristippus; for this last, according to him, is
equally indicative osan insane and distempered mind.

104—128. 104. Siquis emat citharas, ἃς. Stertinius allows the force
of the objection, that it is impossible to decide who is the greater fool,
Staberius or Aristippus 3 but he now gives other instances to determine
the question against the former. Money to a miser is like an instrument
of music in the hands os a man who knows not how to play on it. They
both owe their harmony to the art of using them—105. Nec studio

citharae nec Musae deditus ulli. S“ §either from any love for the lyre,
