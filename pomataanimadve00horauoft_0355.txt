secret calumniators and detractors.—94. Capitolini Petilli. According
to the scholiasts, this Petillius received his surname of Capitolinus from
having been govemor of the Capitol. They add, that hc was accused of
having stolen, during his office, a goldcn crown consecrated to Jupiter, and
that, having pleaded his cause in person, hc was acquittcd by the judges in
order to gratify Augustus, m'th whom he was on friendly terms.—95.
Defendar, ut tuus est mos. “ Go on and defend him in thy usual way?
—99. Sed tamen admiror, &c. This hut, as Francis remarks, spoils
all; and this artful and secret calumny has something infinitely more
criminal in it than the carolem, open freedom of Horace—100. Hic

dyc of the cattle-fish. The loliyo or cuttle-fish emite, when pursued, a
liquor as black as ink, in order to escape by'thus discolouring the waters
nouum-101. Aeruyo mera. “This is pure malignity.‘’ Aeruyo
means literally the rust of copper. as serruyo does that of iron. The
figurative application is extremely beautiful. As the rust eats away the
mem, so does the gnawing tooth of malignity corrode the character of its
victim.—lO·2. Atque animo prius. “ And from my breast before 1
turn to write.''— Ut si quid promittere, διο. The construction is: ‘⁴ Si
quid, ut aliud (i. e. unquam) vere de me promittere possum.''—IO5.
Insuevit hoc me. “Accustomed me to t'nis;” i. e. led me into this
habit, by the peculiar mode of instruction which he adopted in my case.—
106. Ut fuyerem exemplis, δῖε. “ That by pointing out to me each
particular vice in living examples, I might be induced to shun them.”
