490 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Si quaeret quid agam, dic, multa et pulchra minantem,
Vivere nec recte nec suaviter3 haud quia grando
Contuderit vites, oleamve momorderit aestus, 5
Nec quia longinquis armentum aegrotet in agris3

Sed quia mente minus validus quam corpore toto

Nil audire velim, nil discere, quod levet aegrum 3

Fidis offendar medicis, irascar amicis,

hypochondriac. If the poet really intended this for his own portrait, it
must be confess ed to bc xery unlike 1118 Joy ons carelessness of his life in
general. In almost perfect 11831111, possessed of an easy fortune, and
{wipported by a good undeistanding, he makes himself Wletched with
causeless disquietudes, and an unaccountable waywardness of temper.
May we not suppose that the Epicurean principles of Horace forbid any
such application to himself, and 11131 118 merely assumes these 1111111111-
1183. 11131 118 may with more· politeness reproach Albinovanus, who was
actually subject to 1118111. Such at 1833113 the opinion of Torrentius and
others of the commentatore.

1—10. 1. Celso yauclere et bene rem yerere Albinovano, &e. The
order of construction is as follows· M usa royata, refer C'elso Albinova-
no, οοηηιι· scribaeque Neronis ¹qandeoe et yewre ‘rem bene. -Gaudere et
bene oem gerere refer. “Bear joy and prosperity;'' i. e. give joy and
wish success. In place of using the common Latin form of salutation,
Salutem, Horace here imitates the Greek mode of expression, χαίρειν
καὶ εὖ aphraim—‘20 Comitz‘ scribaeque IVerom's. Celsus Albinovanus
has already been mentioned as forming part of the retinue of Tiberius,
(Epist. 1. iii. 15,) who was at that time occupied with the affairs of
Armenia—3. Dic, multa et pulchra minantem, διο. “ Tell him, that,
though promising many fine things, I live neither well nor agreeably.''
The distinction here ,made is one, observes Francis, of pure Epicurean
morality. Recte vivere is to live according to the rules of virtue ; and
vivere szcaviter to have no other 8311131188 for our actions but pleasure
and our passions. As regards the force of minantem, in this same pas-
sage, consult note on Sat. 11. iii. 9.-4, Haud quia gyrando, &c. ‘⁶ Not
because the hail has bruised my vines⁷ or the heat blasted the oh‘ve,''
ἀο- ; i. e. my disquiet 311383 not from the cares of wealth ; it is not pro-
ducedby the feelings that break the repose of the rich, when their vine-
yards have been lashed by the hail, or their olive-grounds have suffered
from the immoderate heats, &c.—-5. Momorderit. ’· Τ118 verb mordeo
(here equivalent to uro) is applied by the Latin writers to denote the
effects as well of cold as of heah—6. Lonyinquz's in cyris. Consult
note on Epode i. 27.—7. illinus validus. ‘⁶ Less sound.” The poet
describes himself (if indeed he refers to his own case) as labouring
under that peculiar malady which is now termed hypochondria, and
which has its seat far more in the mind than in any part of the body.
The picture that he draws admirably delineates the condition of one who
13 suffering under the morbid influence of hypochondriac feelings. -9.
Fidis offendar medicis. ‘Because Ι 3111 displeased with my faithful
phy sicians.'⁷ With irascar, sequar, fuyiam, and amem, respectively,
