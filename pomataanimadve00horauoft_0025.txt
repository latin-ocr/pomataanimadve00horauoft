or MAECENAS. xxi

her away onc moment to take her back the next3 which has led

Seneca to remark, that he wa s married a thousand times yet never
had but one⁴ wife. Terentia vicd in personal chal-ms with the

empress Lffviffi and is said to have gained the affections of Augustus.
The umbrage Maecenas took at the attention paid by his master to
Terentia, is assigned by Dio Cassius as the chief cause of that decline
of imperial favour which Maecenas experienccd about four years
previous to his death. For, although he was still treated externally
with the highest consideration, though he retained all the outward
show of grandeur and interest, and still continued to make a yearly
present to the Emperor on the anniversary of his birth-(lay, he was
no longer consulted in state affairs as a favourite or confidant·
Others have supposed, that it was not the intrigue of Augustus with
Terentia which diminished his influence, but a discovery made by
the emperor, that he had revealed to his wife some circumstances
concerning the conspiracy in which her brother Muraena had been
engaged. Suetonius informs us he had felt some displeasure on that
account3 but Muraena’s plot was discovered in the year 732, and the
decline of Maecenas's political power cannot be placed earlier than
738. The disgust conceived by masters when they have given all,
and by favourites who have nothing more to receive, or are satiated
with honours*, may partly account for the coldness which arose

between Augustus and his minister. But the declininghealth of

Maecenas, and his natural indolence, increasing by the advance of
years, afforded of themselves sufficient causes for his gradual retire-
ment from public affairs, His constitution, which was naturally
weak, had been impaired by effeminacy and luxurious living. He
had laboured from his youth under a. perpetual fever†; and for
many years before his death, hffiuffssere ffifibls'ffffffiffitchfuffiskq
was fond of life and enjoyment3 and of life even without enjoyment.‡
Hence he anxiously resorted to different remedies for the cure or
relies of this distressing malady. Wine, §.oft music sounding at a
distance, and various other contrivances, were tried in vain. At
length, Antonius Musa, the imperial physician, who had saved the
life of Augustus, but accelerated the death of Marcellus, obtained for
him some alleviation of his complaint *by means of the distant mur-
murings of falling water. The sound was artificially procured at his
villa on the Esquiline hul. During this stage of his complaint, how-
ever, Maecenas resided principally in his villa at Tibur, situated on
the banks of the Anio, and near its celebrated cascades. This was
indeed a spot to which Morpheus might have sent his kindest dreams;

he would wish to live even under every accumulation of physical calamity.
