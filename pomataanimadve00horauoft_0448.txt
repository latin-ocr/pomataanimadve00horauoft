406 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Si dura morabitur alvus,

Mitulus et viles pellent obstantia conchae,
Et lapathi brevis herba, sed albo non sine Coo.

Lubrica nascentes implent conchylia lunae; 30
Sed non omne mare est generosae fertile testae.
Murice Baiano melior Lucrina peloris 3
Ostrea Circeiis, Miseno oriuntur echini3
Pectinibus patulis jactat se molle Tarentum.

N ec sibi coenarum quivis temere arroget artem, 35
Non prius exacta tenui ratione saporum.
Nec satis est cara pisces averrere mensa,
Ignarum quibus est jus aptius, et quibus assis
Languidus in cubitum jam se conviva reponet.

Umber et iligna nutritus glande rotundas 40
Curvet aper lances carnem vitantis inertem:

promote digestim, or else at ‘the gustatio, the first part of the coena, con·-
sisting of dishes to excite the appetite3 whence, what was eaten and
drunk to whet the appetite was named promulsis.—27. Si dura morabi-
tur alvus. “If thou art costive ;” literally, “if thy stomach shall be
hard bound.''—28. Conchae. The mention of shell-fish comes in very
naturally here, as they formed, in general, a part of the promulsis.—30.
Lubrica nascentes implent, &c. This is an error much older than the
days of Catius. It is contradicted by constant and universal experience.
-32 Murice Baiano melior Lucrina peloris. “The peloris from the
Lucrine lake is better than the murex from Bajaest' By the peloris is
meant a large kind of shell-fish, or oyster, deriving its name, according
to Athenaeus, from its size, αὶ δὲ πελωρίδες ὠνομάσθησαν παρὰ τὸ
πελώριον. Casaubon‚ however, prefers deducing the name from the
Sicilian promontory of Pelorus, around which they were taken in great
numbers. The murex appears to be the same with the burret, or purple
fish 3 a species of shell-fish from the juice of which 1118 purple dye was
procured.

33—45. 33. Echini. Consult note on Epode v. 27.-34. Pectim'-
bus patulis jactat se, &c. “ The luxurious Tarentum prides herself 011
her broad scallops.'’ The pecten of the Latius is the κτείς of the Greeks,
and both receive their names from the indented and comb-like appear-
ance of their shells—36. Non prius exacta tenui ratione saporum.
“Unless the nice subject of tastes shall have been first carefully con-
sidered by him.”—-37. cara pisces averrere mensa. “ To sweep off the
fishes fiom a dear stall ;'' i. e. to buy them at a high price—38, Qui-
bus est jus aptius, &c. “For which kind sauce is better adapted, and
for which, when broiled, the already sated guest will replace himself on
his elbow ;'’ i. e. will prepare for eating again. The Romans, when
eating at table, lay with the upper part of the body reclined on the left
elbow.-40. Iligna glande. ‘⁶ With the acorn of the holm-oak.’'--
Rotundus curvet ⁶ lances carnem vitantis inertem. “ Bend with its
