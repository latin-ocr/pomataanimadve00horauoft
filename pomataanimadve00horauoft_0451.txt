considered of the best. quality.—69. Pressa Venefmmae quod bacca,
ἃς. The oil of Venafrum was celebrated for its excellence. (Com-
pare Pliny, 15. 3.) Venafrum was the last city of Campania to
the north. It was situate near the river visitamus, and on the Latin
W'ay.—Remisi!. “ Yields.” The aorist, iu the sense of what is accus-
tomed to take place.

70—77. 70. Picenis pomis. Consult note on Sat. 11. iii. 272. Catius
now passes to the second course, consisting of fruits, ece—Tiburtia.
The apples os Tibur are meante—71. Venucula convenit ollis. “ The
Venucula is proper for preserving in jars.'' The allusion here is to a
particular species of grape, of which nothing definite is known at the
present day.-7'2. Duraveris. In the sense of servaveris. The Alban
grape would not seem to have been any of the best—73. Hanc esyo
cum malis, ἃς. “ 1 am found to have been the first that placed here
and there on table, in clean little dishes, this kind of grape along with
apples ι Ι am found to have been the first that served up, in this way,
a sance composed of burnt tartar and fish—pickle: I too am found to
have been the first, that presented thus to my guests white pepper
sprinkled over with black salt.'' The phrase puris circumposuisse catillis
has been necessarily rendered with some freedom, in the two latter
clauses in this sentence, in order to suit better the idiom of our own
tongue. The poet happily expresses, by the repetition of the personal
pronoun and of the adjective primus, the eamest air wath which the merit
of these several important discoveries is claimed—Famem. The ‘⁶ ge-
brannter Weinstein '⁸ of the German commentatorS. Fam· is here equi-
valent ‘to soeoe usta. It was added as a condiment to the halec. Tartar
is an acid concrete salt, formed fiom wines completely fermented, and
adhering.to the· sides of the casks in the form of a hard crust. It is
white or red, the white being ‘most esteemed‚ as containing less dross
or earthy parts. The best comes from Germany, and is the tartar
of the Rhenish wine—75. Incretum. This term properly denota,
“ sprinkled over through a sieve.”—C2‘rcumposuisse. We must not ima-
gine, with some commentators, that the catilli were served up, one to
each guest, but that they were placed here and there (circum) on the
table, aster the manner of the medem assiettes,-76. Jmmane est vitium,
dare millia terna macello, διε. Catius calls it a monstrous folly not to
know how to make an entertainment, aster having gone to an immense
expense at the shambles in the purchase of provisions, Το purchase, for
example, fish of the most costly kind, and then serve them up in small
and narrow dishes where they have to lie piled one upon another.-—77.
