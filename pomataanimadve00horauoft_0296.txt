256 Q. HonA'rn FLAcct

Hic tertius December, ex quo destiti 5
Inachia furere, silvis honorem decutit.
Heu ! me, per urbem, nam pudet tanti mali,
Fabula quanta fui ! conviviorum et poenitet,
In queis amantem et languor et silentium
Arguit, et latere petitus imo spiritus. 10
Contrane lucrum nil valere candidum
Pauperis ingenium! querebar applorans tibi ;
Simul calentis inverecundus deus
Fervidiore mero arcana promorat loco.
Quod si meis inaestuat praecordiis 15
Libera bilis, ut haec ingrata. ventis dividat
Fomenta, vulnus nil malum levantia ‚-
Desinet imparibus certare summotus pudor.
Ubi haec severus te palam laudaveram,

Fabula quanta fui ! ‘¹ What a subject of conversation I have been ! ’'—
Conviviorum et poenitet. &c. “ It repents me too of those enter-
taffiments, at which dejection and silence discovered the lover, and the
sigh heaved from the depth of my heart.’'—ll. Contrane-lucrum, διο.
“ A candid and an honest beart, in one of scanty means, is to avail
nothing then against the love of gain.'’ The train of ideas in this whole
passage is as follows: Thou, O Pectius, must remember how Ι once
complained to thee, when wine had disclosed the secrets of my breast:
how Ι lamented that my sincere and constant affection seemed of no
value in the eyes of Inachia, because Fortune had not blessed me with
abundant means, while, eager for gain, she sought only after wealthy
admirers.—-l3. Simul calentis inverecundus deus, &c- ‘⁵ As soon as the
god, who drives away salse shame from the breast, had removed from their
place the secrete of my beart, warming under the influence of oheering
wine.’⁷ The epithet inverecundus, applied here to Bacchus, is well
explained by Mitscherlich: ‘⁶ Qui verecundiam abstergit, tacenda
proloqui jubet.'' As regards calentis, we must, in a literal translation,
understand with it mei, (“ the secrets of me warming‚'' &c.)—l5. Quod
si meis, δίο. “ But if indignation, no longer to he repressed‚ rage in my
bosom, so as to scatter to the winds these useless remedies, in no
respect alleviating my cruel wound, my shame, being removed, shall
cease to vie with uuequal rivals;” i. e. Ι shall no longer blush at
yielding the prize to wealthier rivals. The fomenta of which the poet¹
speaks, are the hopes which he had all along entertained that Inachia
would at length be sensible of the superior value of his affection. With
this hope he was consoling himself, until at length his indignation at her
neglect could no longer be repressed, and he resolved to abandon her for
