DE GLYCERA.

MATER saeva Cupidinum,
Thebanaeque jubet me Semeles puer,

Et lasciva Licentia,
Finitis animum reddere amoribus.

Urit me Glycerae nitor 5
splendentis Pario marmore purius:

Ona xlx—The poet, after having bid farewell to love, confessos tnat
the beauty of Glycera had again made him a willing captive. veum, Bac-
chus, and Licentia, are the authors of this change, and compel him to
abandon all graver employments. A sacrifice to the first of these denies,
in order to propitiate her influence, now engrosses the attention of the hard.
Some commentators have supposed that the poet’s object in composing this
piece was, to excuse himself to Maecenas for not having celebrated in
song, as the latter requested, the operatious of Angustus against the
Scythians and the Parthians. We should prefer, however, the simplet
and more natural explanation of the ode as a mere sportive effusionn

1-5. l. Mater saeva Cupidinum. “ The cruel mother of the
Loves. ” The Loves, of whom Venus is here reples en ed as the parent,
were many in number, according to the poets. Compare ‘the language of
Statius. (silv. 1. ii. 61, seqq. )—2. Thebanae Semeles puer, Bacchus.

Compare Claudian (IVztpl. Hon. et ΙΙῙιιν. 78); “Nullo constricta
Licentia nod0.’'—5. Nitor. “ The bn'lhaut beauty.’'

6. Pario marmore purius. ‘⁶ The peculim· excellence of the Parian
marble,’' observes Dr. Clarke, ‘⁴ is extolled by Strabo, and it possesses
some valuable qualities unknown even to the ancients who spoke so
highly in its praise. These ualities are that of hardening by exposure
to atmospheric air (which, however, is common to all homogeneous lime-
stone), and the consequent property of resisting decomposition through a.
series of ages, —and this, rather than thes supposed prescience given to
the Parian marble by the ancients‚ may be considered as the cause of
its revalence among the remains of Glccian sculpture. That the Parian
marble was highly and deservedly extolled by the Romans, has been
already shown3 but, in a very early period, when the arts had attained
their full splendom in the age of Pericles, the preference was given by the
Greeks³ not to the marble of Paros, but to th 1t of Mount Pentelicus:

immediate vicinitv of Athens. While, however, the wmks executed in
Pal-ian marble retain, with all the delicate softness of ax, the mild lustre
even of their original polish, those which were finished in Pentelican
marble have been decomposed, and sometimes exhibita surface as earthy
and as rude as common limestone. This is principally owing to veins of

extraneous substances which intersect the Pentelicau guarries, and which
