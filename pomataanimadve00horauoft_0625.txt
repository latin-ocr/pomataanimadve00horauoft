EPISTOLARUM LIB. 11. 2. 581

Quaedam, si credis consultis, mancipat usus:

Qui te pascit ager, tuus est: et villicus Orbi, 160
Quum segetes occat tibi mox frumenta daturas,

Te dominum sentit : das nummos, accipis uvam,

Pullos, ova, cadum temeti : nempe modo isto

Paulatim mercaris agrurn, fortasse trecentiS,

Aut etiam supra, nummorum millibus emtum. 165
Quid refert, vivas numerato nuper an olim?

Emtor Aricini quondam Veientis et arvi

was always present at these formalities, and the purchaser, having a
brazen coin in his hand, struck the balance with this, and then gave it
to the other party by way of price—159. Alancipat usus. To prevent
the perpetual vexation of lawsuits‚ the laws wiscly ordained‚ that pos-
session and enjoyment for a certain number of years should confer a
title to property. This is what the lawyers term the right of prescrip-
tion, usucapio.

160-166, 160. Qui te pascit affer, tuns est. The poet is here arguing
against the folly of heaping up money with a view to purchase lands ;
and contends, that they who have not one foot of ground, are yet in
fact proprietors of whatever lands yield the productions which they
huju-Orbi. The individual here alluded to appears to have been
some wealthy person, whose steward sold annually for him large quan-
tities of grain and other things, the produce of his extensive possessions.
—l6l. Quum seyetes occat. ‘⁶ When he harrows the fieldS.” By seyetes
is here meant the arable land, which is getting prepared by the harrow
for the reception of the grain—162. Te dominnm sentit. ‘⁶ F cels that
thou art the true lord of the soil ;” ι’. e. well knows that the produce is
intended for thee, and that, thus far, thou art to all intents and purposes
the true oswen-165. Emtum. Pul-chased originally by Orbius ; but to
which thou also hast, in one sense, acquired the title of proprietor, not
indeed by a single large payment, like that of Orbius, but by the con-
stant purchase of the produce of the land.-—166. Quid refert, vivas
numerato nuper an olim? ἃς. The idea intended to be conveyed is
this: What difference does it make, whether thou livcst on money laid
out just nOW, or several years ago? (ι’. ε. whether the articles on which
thou art feeding were purchased just now from the lands of another,
or whether they are the produce of lands bought by thee many years
since.) He who purchased, some time ago, possessions situate in the
neighbourhood either of Aricia or of Veii, pays, as well as thou, for
the plate of herbs he sups on, though perhaps he fancies quite other-
wise: he boils his pot at night with wood that he has bought even as
thou dost. And though, when he surveys his possessions, he says,
“ this land is miue‚'' yet the land, in fact, is not his, any more than it
is thine ; for how can that be called the property of any one, which in
the short space of an hour may change masters, and come into the
possession of another by gift, by sale, by violence, or by death Ρ Nume-
rato. Supply nummo.
