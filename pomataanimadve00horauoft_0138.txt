Q. HORATII FLACCI

Tecum Philippos et celerem fugam
Sensi, relicta non benc parmula ς

Quum fracta Virtus, et minaces
Turpe solum tetigere mento.

Sed me per hostes Mercurius celer
Denso pavent-em sustulit- aere :
Te rursus in bellum resorbens
Unda fretis tulit aestuosis.

Ergo obligatam redde Jovi dapem,
Longaque fessum militia latus
Depone sub lauru mea, nec
Parce cadis tibi destinatis.

Oblivioso laevia Massico
Ciboria exple: funde capacibus
Unguenta de conchis. Quis udo
Deproperare apio coronas

As in the battles of Homer

heroes are often carried away by protecting deities from the dangers of
the fight, so, on the present occasion, Mercury, who presided over arts
and sciences‚ and especially over the music of the lyre, is made to
befriend the poet, and to save him from the dangers of the conilict.
