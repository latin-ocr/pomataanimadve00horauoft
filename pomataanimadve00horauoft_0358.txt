318 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Graecorum linguae doctissimus. Inde Forum Appi
Differtum nautis, cauponibus atque malignis.

Hoc iter ignavi divisimus, altius ac nos 5
Praecinctis unum : nimis est gravis Appia tardis.

Hic ego propter aquam, quod erat deterrima, ventri
Indico bellum, coenantes haud animo aequo

Exspectans comites. J am nox inducere terris

Umbras et coelo diffundere signa parabat ε 10
Tum pueri nautis, pueris convicia nautae

lugerem—Huc appelle. Trecentos inseris ,· ohe Ι

Jam satis esa—Dum aes exigitur, dum mula ligatur,

Tota abit hora. Mali culices ranaeque palustres

Avertunt somnos. Absentem ut cantat amicam 15

Multa prolutus vappa nauta atque viator

journey occupied twelve or fifteen days. The poet satirically and comically
describes the inconveniences cncountered on the road, and all the ludi-
crous incidents which occurred.

1—4. 1. IWaymz. This epithet is here applied to the capital, as
marking the difference in size between it and Aricia, though', considered
by itself, the Iatter was no inconsiderable place—Aricia. A city of
Latium, on the Appian Way, a little to the west of Lanuvium, now La
Riccia.—2. Hospitio modico. “ In a middling inn.”—3. Forum Appi.
Now Boryo Lzmyo, near Treponti. The term Forum was applied to
places iu the country where markets were held and justice administered.

because from hence it was usual to embark on a canai, which ran parallel
to the Via Appia, and was called Decennovium, its length being nineteen
miles.

5—24. 5. Hoc iter iynavi divisimus, gre. ‘¹ This part of our route,
which, to more active travellers than ourselves‚ is the journey of a single
day, we lazily took two to accomplish.” The expression altius prae-
cinctis refers to the Roman custom of tueking up the toga in proportion
to the degree of activity that was required; and hence praecinctus, -like
succinctus. comes to denote generally a person of active habits.—7.
Ventri indico bellum. “ Declare war against my stomach ;'’ i. e. take
no supper.—8. Haud animo aequo. ‘⁴ With impatience.”—ll. Tum
pueri nautis, διο. “ Then our slaves began to abuse the boatmen, the
boatmen our slaves.¹’—12. Huc appelle. “ Come to here.'' Thisis the
exclamation of one of the slaves to the men in the canai-boat. The
moment the boat is brought to, a large number crowd on board, and
then arises the second cry from the slave, hidding ‘the boatman stop and
take in no more, as hc has already three hundred on board. The round
number is here used merely to denote a great crowd—13. Aes. “The
