CARMINUM LIB. 111. 29. 185

Nos cantabimus invicem
Neptunum, et virides Nereidum choros: 10
Tucurva recines lyra
Latonam, et celeris spicula Cynthiae :
Summo carmine, 'quae Gnidon
F ulgentesque tenet Cycladas, et Paphon
J unctis visit oloribus ε J · 15
Dicetur merita Nox quoque naenia.

CARMEN XXIX.
AD MAECENATEM.

TYRRHENA regum progenies, tibi
Non ante verso lenc nicrum cado,
Cum flore, Maecenas, rosarum, et
Pressa tuis balanus capillis

the impatience of the poet himself. The lighter uiues, or such as lasted
only from one vintage to another, were kept in cellars 3 but the stronger
and more durable kinds were transferred to another apartment‚ which the
Greeks called ἀποθήκη or wilichi», and'fhe poet, on the present occasion,
horreum.. With the Romans, it was generally placed above the fuma-

As the naenia, or funeral dix-ge, marked the close of existence, so here the
expression is applied to the hymn that ends the banquet, and whose low
and plaiutive numbers invite to repose.

One XXIX—one of the most beautiful lyiic produt-tiens of all anti-
quity. The hard invites his patron to spend a few days beneath his humble
roos, far from splendour and affluence, and from the noise and confusion
of a crowded capital. He bids him diffinies, sor a season, that anxicty sor
