Luem, quam sis mendosus, teste Catone
Defensore tuo pervincam, qui malefacto-s
Emendare· parat cet-sas. Hoc lenius ille,

titude.”-73. Niyrum. In the sense os insaustttm.-—Surre.z·e. For
surreoeisse.-—Improbus. “ The wicked roguc ς ’' alluding to Fuscus.—
74. Sub cultro. The poet pleasantly compares himself to a victim about
to suffer, as it were, ‘² under the knife '' of the sacrificor. The garrulous
manis going to talk him to death.—Casu venit obvius, ὼε. “ As good
luck would have it, his adversary meets him.’' By adversarius is meant
the opposite party in the lawsuit.—76. Licet antestari? ‘² Wilt thou
be a witness to the arrest ?” According to the rules of the Roman law,
a. plaintiff had the right of ordei-ing his opponent to go with him before the
praetor. If he refused the prosecutor took some one present to witness,
b) saying licet antestari. ‘2 lf the peison consented, lie showed' nis acqui-
escence by offering the tip of his ear, (auriculam opponebat, ) which the
prosecutor touched3 and the latter might drag the defendant to court bv
force in any way, even by the neck, accmding to the law of the Twelve
Tables. As regards the peculiar circumstances which warranted the arrest
in the present instance, compare note on verse 37 of the present Satire.-—
77. Auriculam. The ancients believed that the seat of the memory was
in the tip of the ear3 and hence their custom of touching it in order to
remind another of a thing, or for the purpose of calling him to witness any
circumstance or occurrence.

ermn X. -In this piece‚ which' 1s entirely critical, Horace supporta an
opinion which he had formerly pronounced respecting the Satires of Luci-
lius, and which had given offence to the numerous admirers of that ancient
bard-

1. Lucili. The first eight verses of this satire are printed in a different
type from the rest, because it is uncertain whether they were composed by
Horace or not—Catone. The allusion is to valerius Cato, a grammarian
and poet. He lost his patrimony at an early age, and, in consequence,
turned his attention to literary pursuits. Horace here describes him as
preparing 'to amend the ill-wrought verses of Lucilius.

4. Illo. Understand equite. who this grammarian of equestrian rank
was, is unknown.
