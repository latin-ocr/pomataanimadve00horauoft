CARMINUM Lm. 1. 29. 67

Me quoque devexi rapidus comes Orionis
Illyricis Notus obruit undis.

At tu, nauta, vagae ise parce malignus arenae
=Ossibus et capiti inhumato

Particulam dare: sic, 'quodcunque minabitur Eurus *25
Fluctibus Hesperiis, Venusinae

Plectantur silvae, te sospite, multaque merces,
Unde potest, tibi defluat aequo

Ab Jove, Neptunoque sacri custode Tarenti.
Negligis immeritis nocituram 30

Postmodo te natis fraudem committere? Fors et
Debita jura vicesque superbae

Te maneant ipsum : precibus non linquar inultis ;
Teque piacula nulla resolvent.

Quamquam festinas, non est mora longa; licebit 35
Injecto ter pulvere curras.
