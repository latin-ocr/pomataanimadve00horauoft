52 Q. HORATII FLACCI

CARMEN XXI.
IN mmm ET APOLLINEM.

DIANAM tenerae dicite virgines:
Intonsum, pueri, dicite Cynthium:
Latonamque supremo
Dilectam penitus «Iovi.

Latium, near Caieta.-—12. Pocula. These were the drinking—cum, into
which the wine was pour-ed, after having been diluted with water in the
crater, or mixer. Hence the expression temperant. The clause may be
parap rased as follows: “ Neither the produce of the Falernian vines,

nor that of the Formian hius, mingles in my cups with the tempering

water. ' ⁹ ‘'¹'‘—

Omz XX1.—A Hymn in praise of Apollo and Diana, which has {iven
rise to much diversity of opinion among the learned. Many regard it as
a piece intended to be sung in alternate stanzns by a chorus of youths
and maidens on some solemn festival. Acron refers it to the saecular
Games3 and Sanad0n‚ who is one of ‘those that advocate mim
actua y removes the ode from its present place, and makes it a comno-
nent art of the saecular hymn. Others again are in favour of the Ludi
Hpoliinaremeven is perfect] y arbitrary. No satisfactory
arguments can be adduced for making the present ode an amoebaean com-
position, nor can it be fairly proved that it was ever customary for

‘'sii—ch-l’iymns to be sung in alternate chorus. Resides, there are some
things in the ode directi y at variance with such an opinion. Let us adopt
for a moment the distribution of parts which these commentators recom-
mend, and examine the result. The first line is to be sung by the chorus
of youths, the second hythe chorus of maidens, while both united sing the
·third and fourth. Iu the succeeding stamas, the lines from the fifth to
the eighth inclusive are assigned to the youth8‚ and from the ninth to the
twelfth inclusive to the maidens? while the remaining lines arc again sung
by the double chorus. In order to effect this arrangement, we must change
with these critics the i 'tial Hic in the thirteenth line to Haec, in allu-
sion to Diana, makingfflffi'ierence to Apollo begin at hic miseram.
Now, the impropriety of making the youths sing the praises of Diana.
(verses 5—8), and the maidens those of Apollo (v. 9—12)‚ must be
apparent to every unprcjudiced observet, and forms, we conceive, a fatal
error. Nor is it by any means a feeble objection, whatever grammatical
subtleties may be called in to explain it away, that motus occurs in the
sixteenth line. If the concluding stanza is to commencc with the praises
of Diana as sung by the youths, then evidently motus should be mota,
which would violate the measure. The conclusion, therefore, to which we are
drawn is simply this t the present ode is merely a private effusion, and not
intended for any public solemnity. The poet only assumes in imaginatiou
the office of choraguS‚ and seeks to instruct the chorus in the proper dis-
charge of their general duties.
