SAT1REI.—A desire of amassing enormous wealth was one of the·
most prevalent passione of the ti1ne3 and, amid the struggles of civil
warfare, the lowest of mankind had succeeded in accumulating fortuncs.
It is against this inordinate rage that the present satire is directed. In a
dialogue supposed to be held between the poet and a miser, the former
exposes the folly of those who oecupy themselves solely in the acquisition
of weahh, and replies to all the arguments which the miser adduces in
favour of boarding. (Dunlop's Roman Literature, vol. iii. p. 247.)

1—22. l. Qui fit Maecenas, &c. The construction is as follows:
Qui fit, Maecenas, ut nemo vivat contentus illa sorte, quam sortem seu
ratio dederit, seu sors objecerit, ut laudet sequentes diversa ,⁶2 “ How
happens it, Maecenas, that no man lives contented with that lot, which
either reflection may have given him or chance have thrown in his way,
but rather deems their condition enviable who follow pursuits in life that
are different from his own ?'’ Ratio here denotes that deliberation and
reflection which direct our choice in selecting a career for life.-—4. O
fortunati mercatores. “ Ah! ye happy traders.” As regards the peculiar
meaning of the term mercator, consult note on Ode 1. i. 16.-7. Militia
