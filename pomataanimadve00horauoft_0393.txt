SERMONUM Lm. Ι. lO- 353

Defendente vicem modo rhetoris atque poetae,

Interdum urbani, parcentis viribus, atque

Extenuantis eas consulto. Ridiculum aeri

Fortius et. melius magnas plerumque secat res. 15
Illi, scripta. quibus Comoedia prisea viris est,

Hoc stabant, hoc sunt imitandi 3 quos neque pulcher

Hermogenes unquam legit, neque simius iste,

Nil praeter Calvum et, doetus cantare Catullum.—

At maynum fecit, quod verbis Graeca Latinis 20

Miscuit—O seri studiorum ! quine putetis

rallier, who eurbs the force of his pleasantry and purposely weakens it.’'
—14. Ridiculum acri fortius et melius, διο. “ Ridicule often decides
matters of importance more effectually, and in a better manner, than
severity of satirc.’' This serves as au explanatory comment on what
precedes, viz. “parcentis viribus,'' ἃς.

16-19. 16. Illi, scripta quibus, &a ‘⁶ The constructionis Illi viri,
quibus viris prisea Comoedia scripta est. ‘⁴ The writers of the Old Co—
medy.” Consult note on Serm. 1. iv. 2.-17. Hoc stabant. “ Pleased in
this.'· In like manner, a play which pleased from beginning to end was
said, by the ancients, “stare.’'—Pulcher Hermogenes. “ The smooth
faced Hermogenes.'' This appears aimed at the effeminate habits of
the man. The Hermogenes here alluded to is the same with the singer
whose death is mentioned in the commenccment of the second Satire.
We must bear in mind that these productioris of Horace are not
arranged in the order of time—18. Simius. The poet either means by
this contemptuous appellation, to designate some pcrformor of the day
who made himself ridiculous by his ape-like imitation of Hermogenes,
or else some individual of a dwarflsh and deformed persou.-l9. Nil
praeter Calvum, ἆυ. “ Who is skilled in nothing but singing the com-
positions of Calvus and Catullus.'’-Calvum. The allusion is to C.
Licinius Calvus, who was equally distinguished as an orator and a poet.
He is classed by Ovid among the licentious writers3 and it is to this
character of his writings that Horace here seems to allude.—Catullum.
The celebrated Catullus, well known as an elegant though most licentious
poet. ·

20—23. 20. Aa maynum secit‚&c. One of the admirere of Luci-
lius is here introduced, who urges, as a deeidcd proof of his high merit,
the intermixture of Greek with Latin words. The poet's reply is given
in the following line.—2l. O seri studiorum Ι “ Ye late learned ;'' i. e.
γε who are but little advanced in the paths of learning, to which your
attention has only at alate period been directed. Seri studiorum means
properly those who begin not their studies until ata late period of life.
As they never, in general, arrive at any great degree of peffection, so the
pains they are forced to be at, in order to master the easiest subjecte,
make them apt to admire trifles, such as Greek mixed with Latin,v for
example, iu the mitiugs of Lucilius.—Qu'ine putetis. “ How can you
think ?''—22. Rhodio Pitholeonti. Compare the explanation of the
scholiast: “ Dicitur Pitholeon epigrammata ridicula (i. e. inepta) scrip-
