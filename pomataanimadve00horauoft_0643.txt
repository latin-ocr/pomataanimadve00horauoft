EPISTOLA ,11) Prsoxm. 599

Singula quaeque locum teneant sortita decenter.
Interdum tamen et vocem Comoedia tollit,

Iratusque Chremes tumido delitigat ore:

Et tragicus plerumque dolet sermone pedestri. 95
Telephus et Peleus, quum pauper, et exsul, uterque
Projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba,

Si cor spectantis curat tetigisse querela.

Non satis est pulchra esse poemata; dulcia sunto,

frequently exhibited on the Roman stage, gives great force and spirit
to the precept, at the same time that it exemplifies it in the happiest
manner.''—94. Sinqala quaeque Iocum teneant sortita decenter. “ Let
each particular species of writing, when once it has had its proper
place allotted to it, hold that place in a becoming manner.” The
construction is, sinyula quaeque, sortita locum, “teneant eum locum
decenter.''

93-96. 93. Vocem tollit. “ Raises its voice.'' Compare the scho-
liast ; “ Granclioribus verbis ulitar‚'’ and note on verse 86, toward the
close—94. [ratusque Chremes tumido delitiyat ore. “And angry
Chremes rails in swelling strain ;” alluding to the Heautontimorumenos
of Terence (Act 5. Sc. 4) where the irritated Chremes breaks out
against his som—‘95 Et tragicus plerumque dolet sermone pedestui.
“And sometimes the tragic poet grievcs in humble style.'' The
poet, by a common figure, is here made to do what he represents his
characters as doingc-OG. Telephus et Peleus. The stories of each ot*
these princes became the subjects of tragedies. The allusion in the
case of Telephus is to lus wanderings in quest of his parents, and to
the poverty in which he was involved at the time. Peleus, as is well
known, was driven into exile from the court of his father [liaeus for
having been accessory to the murder of his brother Phorbas—Uter-
que projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba. “ Cast each aside high-
sounding expressions and words a-foot-and-a-half-long.‘¹ The term
ampulla properly denotes a species of phial or flask for holding oil or
vinegar, having a narr-ow neck but swelling out below. Hence the
word is figuratively taken to signify inflated diction, tumid language‚
bombast, rant, ἃς.

is not enough that poems be beautiful, let· them also be affectinal'
The reference in pegmata is principally to dramatic compositiona—
The following outline will give a connected view of the remainder of
this epistle. Horace's discrimination of the several styles that belong
to the different species of poetry, leads him, as has before ·been
remarked, to consider the Diction of the drama, and its accommodation
to the circumstances and cham ter of the speaker. A recapitulation of
these circumstances carries him on to treat of the due management of
characters already known, as well as of sustaining those that are entirely
original. To the first of these the poet gives the preference, recom-

tion of this joint preference, the author leaves farther consideration of
