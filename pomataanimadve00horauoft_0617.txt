Tres mihi convivae prope dissentire videntur,
Poscentes vario multum diversa palato.
Quid dem? quid non dem? Renuis quod tu, jubet alter ;
Quod petis, id sane est invisum acidumque duobus,

this time in his fisty-first year, and too old for the task.-57. Tendunt
eoetorquere po'e‘mata. “They are now striving to wrest from mc poetry ;'⁷
i. e. to deprive me of my poetic powers—Quid faciam vis? “What
wouidst thou have me do ?'' i.e. on what kind of verse wouldst thou
have me employ myself?—58. Denique non omnes euclem mirantur ”
amantque. The difference of tastes among mankind furnishes Horace
with a fourth excuse, such as it is, for not writing. The poet, how-
ever, knew his own powers too well to be much, if at all, in earnest
here—59. Carmine. “ In Lyric strains.”-—GO. Bioneis sermonibus ec
sale nigro. “With Satires written in the manner of Bion, and with the
keenest raillery.'’ The individual here referred to under the name of
Bion, is the same that was sur-named Borysthenites, from his native
place Borysthenes. He was both a philosopher and a poet ; but, as a
poet, remarkable for his bitter and virulent satire. He belonged to the
Cyrenaic sect.—Sale niyro. The epithet Ἰιιὶρνο is here used with a
peculiar reference to the severity of the satire with which an individual
is assailed. In the same sense the verses of Archilochus (Epist. 1. xix.
3.) are termed atrax—61. Tres mihi convivae prope dissentire videntur.
“ They appear to me to differ almost like three guests.'’ The particle
of compar-ison (veluti or sicuti) is again omitted, in accordance with the
frequent custom of Horace. Consult note on verse 8. The parties
who appear to the poet to differ in the way that he describes, are those
whose respective tastes in matters of poetry he has just been describing.
—64. Invisum. “ Of unpleasant savour;”

65—74. 65. Praeter cetera. “Above all ;’' equivalent to prae caeteris
aliis. The reason here assigned is not, like the last, a mere pretext.
The noise and bustle of a great city, and the variety of business trans-
aeted there, occasion such distraction of spirit as must ever greatly
disturb a poet's commerce with the muse—67. Hie sponsum vocat.
‘⁴ This one calls me to go bail for him.’'—-Auditum scripta. ‘⁶ To hear
him read his works ;” alluding to the custom of an author’s reading
his productioris before friends, and requesting their opinions upon the
merits of the piece or pieces.—-68. Cubat. ‘⁶ Lies siek.'' Compare,
