280 ΟΝ ROMAN SATIRE.

nas carried his buffoons along with him, to contribute to the sport which
the absmdities of their host supplied.

In the time of Augustus, the practice which' 111 modern times has been
termed leyaey- lcuntiny, became literally a profession and employment.
Those who followed it did not, like the parasites of old, content them-
selves with the offals from the board of a patron. Assiduous flattery,
paid to a wealthy and childless bachelor, was considered at Rome as
the surest and readiest mode of enrichment, after the confiscatione of
property were at an end, and the plundering of provinces was prohibited.
The desire of amassing wealth continued, though the methods by which
it was formerly gained were interdicted, and the Romans had not
acquired those habits which might have procured it more honourable
gratification.

About the same period, philosophy, which never had made much pro-
gress at Rome, was corrupted and perverted by vain pretenders. The
unbending principles of the Stoics, in particular, had been carn'ed to so
extravagaut a length and were so little in accordance with the feeling
of the day, or manners of a somewhat voluptuous court, that whatever
ridicule was cast upon them could scarcely fail to be generally acceptable
and amusing.

In the age of Augustus the Romans had become a nation of poets, and
many who had no real pretensions to the character sought to occupy in
rhyming that time which, in the days of the Republic, would have been
employed in more worthy exertions. The practice, too, of recitatione to
friends, or in public assemblies, was introduced about the same period3 and
it was sometimes no easy matter to escape from the vanity and importunity
of those who were predetermined to delight their neighbours with the
splendour and harmony of their verses. In short, foppery and absurdity
of every species prevailed ; but the Augustam age was one rather of folly
than of atrocious crime. Augustus had done much for the restoration of
good order and the due observance of the laws ; and, though the vices of
luxury had increased, the salutary effects of his administration checked
those more violent offences that so readily burst forth amid the storms of
an agitated republic. Nor did the comt of Augustus present that frightful
scene of impurity and cruelty‚ which, in the reign of Domitian, raised the
scorn, and called forth the satiric indignation of Juvenal. In the time of
Horace, Rome was rather a theatre, where' inconsistency and folly performed
the chief parts, and where nothing better remained for the wisc thau to
laugh at the comedy which was enacted.

That Horace was not an indifferent spectator of this degradation of
his country, appears from his glowing panegyrics on the ancient patriots
of Rome, his retrospects to a better age, and to the simplicity of the
‘⁵ prisea yens mortalium. ⁷ ' But no better weapon was left him than
the light shafts of ridicule. What could he have gained by pursuing
the guilty sword in hand, as it were, like Lucilius, or arrogating to him-
self among courtiers and men of ‘the world the character of an ancient
censor? The tone which he struck was the only one that suited the
period and circumstances: it pervades the whole of his Satires, andis
assumed, whatever may be the folly or defects which he thinks himself
called on to expose. A wide field in those days was left open for
satine, as its province was not restricted or pre· occupied by comedy.
At Rome there never had been any national drama' m which Roman life was
