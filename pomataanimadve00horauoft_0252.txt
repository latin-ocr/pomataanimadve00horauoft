212 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Gaudes carminibus ; carmina possumus

Donate, et pretium dicere muneri.

Non incisa notis marmora publicis,

Per quae spiritus et. vita redit bonis

Post mortem ducibus ; non celeres fugae, 15
Rejectaeque retrorsum Hannibalis minae,

[Non stipendia Carthaginis impiae‚]

Ejus, qui domita nomen ab Africa

Lueratus rediit, clarius indicant

Laudes. quam Calabrae Pierides: neque, 20
Si chartae sileant, quod bene feceris,

Mercedem tuleris. Quid foret Iliae

or desire any more—11. Gaudes carminibus, διε. “ Thy delight is in
verses : verses we can bestow, and can fix a value on the gift.‘' The nain
ofideas is as follows z Thou carest far less for the things that have just been
mentioned, than for the prod-actions of the Muse. Here we can bestow
a present, and can explain, m0re0vc1·‚the true value of the gift. Cups,
and vases, and tn'pods, are estimated in accordance with the caprice and
luxury of the age, but the farne of verse is immortal. The bard then
proceeds to exemplify the never-dying honours which his art can
bestow.

13-33. 13. Νοη incisa notis, &c. “ N’ot marbles marked with
public insen'ptions‚ by which the breathing of life returns to illustrious
leaders after death.” Incisa is literally “ cut in‚'' or ‘⁶ engraved.''—-
15. IVon celeres suque, διε. “ Not the rapid slight of Hannibal, nor his
threats hurled back upon him.'’ The expression celeres fugae refers ω
the sudden departure of Hannibal from Italy, when recalled by the
Carthaginians to make head against Scipio. He had threatened that
he would overthrow the power of Rome3 these threats Scipio burled
back upon him, and humbled the pride of Carthage in the field of Zama.
—17. Non stipendia Carthaginis impiae. “ Not the tribute imposed
upon perfidious Carthage.” 'l‘he common reading is Non incendia
Carthaginis impiae, which involves an historical error, in ascribing the
overthrow of Hannibal and the destruction of Carthago to one and the
same Scipio. The elder Scipio imposed a tribute on Carthage after the
battle of Zama, the younger destroyed the cirta—18. Ejus, qui domita,
&a The order of construction is as follows: Clarius indicant landes
ejus, qui rediit lucratus nomen ab Africa domita, quam, &a Scipio
obtained the affliomen of “ Ajricanus '' from his conquests in Africa, a
title subsequently bestowed on the younger Scipio, the destroyer of
Carthage.—20. Calabrae Pierides. ‘⁵ The Muses of Calabria.'’ The
allusion is to the poet Ennius, who was born at Rudiae in Calabria, and
who celebrated the exploits of his friend and patron, the elder Scipio,
in his Annals or metrical chrouicles, and also in a poem connected
with these Annals, aud devoted to the praise of the Roman commander.
—Neque, si chartae sileant, &c. ‘⁶ Nor, if writings be silent, shalt thou
reap any reward for what thou mayest have laudably accompiished.'’
