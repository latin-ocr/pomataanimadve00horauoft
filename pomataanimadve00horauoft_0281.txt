“ AT, o deorum quicquid in coelo regit

Terras et humanum genus !

Quid iste fert turnultus? aut· quid omnium
Vultus in unum me truces ’ἕ

Per liberos te, si vocata partubus 5

Per hoc inane purpurae decus precor,
Per improbaturum haec J ovem,

Quid ut noverca, me intueris, aut uti
Petita ferro bellua ?''— 10

Ut haec tremente questus ore constitit
Insignibus raptis puer,

Impube corpus, quale posset impia
Mollire Thracum pectora ;

Epope V.-—The bard ridicules Canidia, who, herself advaneed in years,
was seeking by incantations and charnis to regain the affectious of the old
and foolish Varus. A strange scene of magic rites is introduced, and the
piece opens with the piteous exclamations of a boy of noble birth, whom
Canidia and her associate hags are preparing to kill by a slow aud dreadful
process, and from whose marrow and dried liver a philter or love-potion is
to be prepared, all-powerful for recalling the inconstant VaruS. It will be
readily perceived that the greater part of this is mere fiction, aud that the
real object of the poet is to inflict well-merited chastisement on those
females of the day, in whose licentious habits age had been able to produce
no alteration, and who, when their beauty had departed, had recourse to
strange and superstitious expediente for securing admirers.

1—24. l. At, o deorum, διο. The scene opens, as we have already
remarked, with the supplications of a boy, who· is supposed to be surrounded
by the hage, and who reads their purpose in their looks. He conjures them
to have compassion on him by the tenderness of mothers for their children,
by his birth, and by the justice of the gods-4. Truces. ⁴⁴ Fiercely
turned.’'-5. Partubus veris ,· alluding to the frequent stealing of infants
on the part of these hags.—7. Per hoc inane, δίο. “ By this vain orna>
ment of purple.” Young men of family wore a gown bordered with purple,
called the toya praetexta, until the age of seventeen, when they put on
the toya virilis. The epithet inane expresses the disregard of Canidia
for this emblem of rank—9. Aut uti petita, &c. “ Or like a savage
beast of prey wounded by the dart.''—l 1. Ut haec tremente, διο. “ When
the boy, after having uttered these complaints with trembling lips, stood
among them, with his ornaments stripped off, a tendet body,’' διο. Under
