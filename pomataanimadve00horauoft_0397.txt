SERMONUM Lm. 1. 10. 357

Quid vetat et nosmet Lucili scripta legentes

Quaerere, num illius, num rerum dura negarit

Versiculos natura magis factos et euntes

Mollius, ac si quis, pedibus quid claudere senis,

Hoc tantum contentus, amet scripsisse ducentos 60
Ante cibum versus, totidem coenatus? Etrusci

Quale fuit Cassi rapido ferventius amni

Ingenium, capsis quem fama est esse librisque

combustum propriis. Fuerit Lucilius, inquam,

Comis et urbanis ; fuerit limatior idem, 65
Quam rudis set Graecis intacti carminis auctor,

Quamque poetarum seniorum turba: sed ille,

Si foret hoc nostrum fato delatus in aevum,

Detereret sibi multa, recideret omne, quod ultra

Perfectum traheretur, et in versu faciendo 70

him?'·—57. Num illius, num rerum, &c. “ WVhether his own genius,
or the difficult nature of the topics Which he handles, has dcnied him
verses in any respect more finished, and flowing more smoothly, thanis
one, satisfied merely with this, with confining namely anything whatever
in the limits of six feet,'' ὄις. i. e. within the limits of an hexameter
verse.—61. Etrusci Cassi. The “ Etrurian Cassius,” here spoken of,
appears to have been a distinct individual from the “ Cassius of Pa1·ma,’'
(Cassius Parmensis,) mentioned in Epist. 1. ἰν. 3. though confoundcd
with 'nim by some. Of the Etrurian Cassius we know little, if anyffiiug,
except that he was a most rapid mitem—63. Capsis quem sama est, ἃς.
“ who, as the story goes, was burned at the funeral pile by means of
his own book-cases and p1·oductions.'’ A satirieal allusion to the number
of his works. So many were they, that, together with the cases that
contained them, they fumished fuel enough to consume his corpse. The
story, of course, may be believed or not, as wc see fit ι the poet's object
is answered notwithstanding.—-64. Fuerit Lucilius, inquam, διε.
“Gi-ant, 1 say, that Lucilius is a courtly and plcasing writcr3 grant
that he is also more polished than Ennius, the first wn'ter in a species
of poetry then still rudeJin its character, 'and never attempted by the
Greeks.'’ The word auctor is here equivalent to scriptor.—-66. Rudis
et Graecis intacti carminis. Satire is meant. Compare Remarks on
Roman Satire.

67-77, 67. Sed ille, &c. The reference is to Ennius, and the idea
intended to be conveyed is as follows ε Grant that Lucilius is superior in
grace and polish to Ennius, yet the latter. (sed ille‚) were he to live in
this our age. would not, like Lucilius, leave behind him many things
deserving of being removed and cast away, but would retrench whatever
appeared objectionable or supeffluous 3 neither would he again, like that
same poet, pour forth a host of verses rapidly composed, but would exer-
cise in their formation the utmost circumspection and care.—70. Ec in
versusaciendo. ·‘ And in polishing his veme.''-71. Saepe caput sea-
