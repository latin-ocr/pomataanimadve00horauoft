254 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Vel, quod fluentem nauseam coerceat, 35
Metire nobIs Caecubum.

Curam metumque Caesaris rerum juvat.
Dulci Lyaeo solvere.

CARMEN X.
IN MAEVIUM ΡΟΕΤΑΜ.

MALA soluta navis exit alite,
Ferens olentem Maevium.
Ut horridis utrumque verberes latus,
Auster, memento fluctibus.
Niger rudentes Eurus, inverso mari. 5
Fractosque remos differat ;
Insurgat Aquilo, quantus altis montibus
Frangit trementes ilices;
Nec sidus atra nocte amicum appareat,
Qua tristis Orion cadit ,· 10

Edi?- Rerum. “For the interests.”—38. Lyaeo. Consult note on
1. xxii. 4.

Epona X.--Addressed to Maevius, a contemptible poet of the day,
who was on the eve of embarking for Greece. The bar—d prays heartily
that he may be shipwrecked‚ and vows a sacrifice to the storms if they
will but destroy him. This Maevius is the same with theone to whom
virgil satirically alludes in his 3d &10qu (v. 90,) ‘⁴ Qui Bavium non
odit, amet tua carmina, Maevi.” He would seem to have incurred
the resentment of both virgil and Horace by his raih'ng aud slanderous
propensities.

1-24. l. Mala soluta, &c. ‘¹ The vessel, loosened from her moor-
inge, sails forth under evil auspices, bearing as she does the fetid
Maevius.’'—2. Olentem. Compare the explanation of Mitscherlich:
‘⁴ Hire-ini odoris hominem.” Rutgersius (Lect. Venus. x. 10) thinks,
that this epithet is rather meant to be applied to the character of
Maevius as a poet, and to his affectatiou of obsolete words. There is far
more of bitter satire, however, in olentem, if considered as a personal
allusion.—3. Utrumque latus. “ Each side of her.⁷⁷ Understand navis.
—4. Auster. The poet enumerates the winds Auster, Eurus, and
Aquilo, in order to convey a, livelier image of a tempest, by the con-
tendjng together of these opposing blasts.-—5. Nz'yer rudentes Eu-
rus, &cz “ May the dark south-east wind seatter her rigging and her
shivered oars in the sea turned up from its lowest depths.”—7. Quantus.
“ With as great fury as‚'' i. e. with all the fury it has, when, δια-8.
Trementes. “W'aving to and fro beneath the blast.”—9. Sidus ami-
cum. ⁴‘ The star friendly to mariners ; '' the allusion is to the Dioscuri.
