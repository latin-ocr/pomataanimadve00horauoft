With regard to the caesura of the foot, it is worth noticing‚ that in thc
Greek Sapphics thero is no necessity sor any conjunction of tho component
feet by caesura, but every foot may be terminatcd by au entire word.
This freedom forms the characteristic feature of the Grcck Sapphic, and
is what chiefly distinguishes it from the Latin Sapphic, as exhibited by
Horace.

In Sapphics‚ the division of a word between two lines frequently occurs;
and, what is remarkable, not compound but simplo words, separately void
of all meaning ; as,

Labitur ripa, Jove non probante, u-
ιπονηιε amnis.

This circumstance, together with the fact of such a division taking
place only between the third Sapphic and the concluding Adonic*, has
induced an eminent prosodian (Dr. Carey) to entertain the opinion,
that neither Sappho, nor Catullus, nor Horace, ever intended the stanza
to consist of four separate verses, but wrote it as three, viz. two five-font
Sapphics, and one of seven feet (including the Adonic); the fifth foot of
the long verse being indiscriminately either a spondeo or a trochee.

The Choriambic Pentameter consists of a spondee, three choriambi, and
an iambus ; as,

Τι“ι n? 1 quaesieris, Ι scire ηξίᾶε, Ι quem mihi, quem Ι tibi.

The proper Choriambic Tetrametcr consists of three choriambi and a
bacchius (i. e. an iambus and a long syllable) 3 as,
ιῘᾱηέ ρᾶιέν, 1 ἆᾶηέ mens, Ι dive biceps, 1 biformis.
(Sept. Serenum)

Horace, however. made an alteration, though not an improvement, by
substituting a spondee instead of an iambus, in the first measure, viz.

Te decis ‹3er SJbiz‘rin 1 οὖν properis Ι ἅηιᾶηάὸ.
The Clioriambic Tetrameter‚ in its original, state, was called Phalaecian,
from the poet Phalaecius, who used it in some of his compositions.

* The divisions which take place between the other lines of the Sapphic
stanzn, when they are not common cases of Synapheia, (as in Horace,
δαν-φη. 11. ii. 18.) will be found to regard compozmd words only, and not
simple ones. The Ode of Horace (¹V· ii.), Which begine,

{iydarum quisquis studet aemulari
u e—

furnishes no exception to this remark. A Syuaeresis operates in Iule,
which must be read as if written Yule.
