136 Q. HORATH FLAcct

Seu voce nunc mavis acuta,
Seu fidibus citharaque Phoebi.

Auditis? an me ludit amabilis 5
Insania? Audire et videor pios
Errare per lucos, amoenae
Quos et aquae subeunt et aurae. J

Me fabulosae, Vulture in Appulo
Nutricis egtra limen Apuliae, 10
Ludo fatigatumque somno
Fronde nova puerum palumbes

Texere: mirum quod foret omnibus,
Quicunque celsae nidum Acherontiae‚
Saltusque Bantinos, et arvum 15
Pingue tenent humilis Forenti ;

trolled aud regulated by wirsdom and moderation.

poet fancies that the Muse, having heard his invocation, has descended from
the skies, aud is pouriug forth a melodious strain. Hence the question,
putto those who are supposed to be standing around, whether they also
hear the accents of the goddess. Fea, 0118 of the modern commentatore
011 Horace, gives on conjecture Audiri-5? in the sense of “ Are* you
heard by me ἓ ” “ Do you answer my invocation Ρ ”—Amabilis insania. “
