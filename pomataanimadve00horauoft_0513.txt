nrrs'romnmu Lm. 1. 5. 471

Et domus et victus, non deficiente emmena?

Inter spem curamque, timores inter et iras, ,

Omnem crede diem tibi diluxisse supremum :

Grata superveniet, quae non sperabitur, hora.

Me pinguem et nitidum bene curata cute vises, 15
Quum ridere voles Epicuri de grege porcum.

EPISTOLA V.
AD TORQUATUM.

SI potes Archiacis conviva recumbere lectis
Nec modica coenare times olus omne patella,

no single term in our languzifge capable of expres-sing the full force of
qratia as here employed. It is used, in the present instance, in what
grammarians term both a passive and an active sense, denoting as well
the favour of the powcrful towards Tibullus, as that pcculiar deportment
on his own part, by which he had conciliated the csteem and confidence
of others.

1‘2-16, 12. Inter spem curamque, «Sec. The advice here given is
that by which Horace regulated his own course of conduct. An Epi-
curean, observes Sanadon, who considers every day as his last, will enjoy
the pleasure that day brings. He bounds all his hopes, fears, cares, and
projects‚ in this little eompass, without disquieting himself about what
may happen on the morrow, which neither depends upon him nor he
upon it. Such is the doctrine to which Horace attributes his own joyous
plight of body, his good-humour, and easy carelessness of life—15.
Pinyuem et nitidum bene curata cute. “ F at and sleek with good keep—
ing.”-16. Epicuri de yreye porcum. This serves to keep up and
render more definite the allusion contained in the preceding lines
The Epicureans, in consequence of the corrupt and degenerate maxims
of some of their number relative to pleasure, were stigmatized, in the
popular language of the day, as mere sensualistS, though many of them
were most undeserving of this obloquy. Horace, therefore, playfully
applies to himself one of the well-known phrases that were wont to be
used by their enemies, as a sweeping denunciation of all the followers of

Epicurus.

EPIS'rLE V.—The poet invites Torquatus to come and sup with him
on the morrow, the festival of Julius Caesar’s nativity. He promises
him a homely entertainment, but a welcome reception, and that what is
wanting in magnificence shall be made up in neatness and cleanliness.
We have in this epistle some strokes of morality, for which Torquatus
might possibly bave occasion. They are enlivened by a panegyric on
wine, short, but spirited, as if it were a declaration of the good-humour

with which he proposed to receive his guest.

1-4, 1. Si potes Archiacis conviva, ὅτε. “ If thou canst prevail on
thyself to recline as a guest upon short couches made by Archias.'’
The short couchae made by Archias, a mechanic of the day, were plain
