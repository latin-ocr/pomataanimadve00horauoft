Quod, si comminuas, rilem rede‘yatur ad assem.—

At, ni id fit, quid habet pulchri constructus acervus?
Millia frumenti tua triveritarea centum3 45
N on tuus hoc capiet venter plus ac meus: ut, si
Reticulum panis venales inter onusto

Forte vehas humero, nihilo plus accipias, quam

Qui nil portarit. Vel dic, quid reserat intra

Naturae fines viventi, jugera centum an 50
Mille aret 2—-At suave esc ex mayno tollere acervo.—
Dum ex parvo nobis tantundem haurire relinquas,

Cur tua plus laudes cumeris granaria nostris 2

Ut tibi si sit opus liquidi non amplius urna

Vel cyatlio, et dicas: stlagno deflumine malim, 55
Quam ea: hoc fonticulo tantundem sumere. Eo fit,
Plenior ut si quos delectet copia justo,

Cum ripa simul avulsos ferat Aufidus acer:

At qui tantuli eget, quanto est opus, is neque limo
Turbatam haurit aquam, neque vitam amittit in undis. 60

silver and of gold ?''—43. Quod, si comminuas, διο. The miser is hero
supposed to answer in dcfence of his conduct. “ Because, if once thou
beginnest to take from it, it may be reduced to a wretched as.'’ There-
fore, argues the miser, it had better romain untouched in the earth.—
44. At, ni id fit, &c. The poet here replies to the miser's argument z
“ But, unless this is done, (i. e. unless thou brcakest in upon thy wealtb,)
what charms does the accumulated hoard contain?”—45. Millia sru-
menti tua triverit, Sco. “ Thy threshiug-floor may have yielded a hun-
dred thousand mensures of grain, still thy stomach w1ll contain‚ on that
account, no more of it than mine.'' With centum millia supply modio-

Panarium, (de Livy. Lat. iv. 22,) was a specics of sack or bag, wrought in
the form of a net, in which the slaves were wont to carry bream—Venales.
Equivalent to servos.—50. Viventi. , Α dative after the impersonal
refert, as in the present instance, is unusual, but cannot, therefore, be
pronounced incorrect, as some maintain it to be, who substitute viventis.
—5l. At suave est, &c. A new argument on the part of the miser.
‘¹ But it is pleasing to take from a large heap.''—52. Dum ex parvo
nobis, διο. We have here the poet's reply, simple aud natuml, and iin-
possible to be controverted ε “ If thou permittcst us to take just as much
from our small heap, why shouldst thou extol thy granai-ies above our
humble meal-tubs ? '' i. e. while our wants can be as easily supplied from
our scanty stores, what advantage have thy granai-ies over our small
meal—tubs .>—54. Liquidi non amplius urna vel cyatho. “ No more
than a pitcber or cup of water.”—56. Quam ea: hoc fonticulo. “ Than
froin this little fountain that flows at my feet.'’—Eo fit, plenior ut si
