N on ante devictis Sabaeae
Regibus, horribilique Medo

, Nectis catenas? Quae tibi virginum, 5
Sponso necato, barbara serviet?
Puer quis ex aula capillis
Ad cyathum statuetur unctis, .

Doctus sagittas tendere Sericas
Arcu paterno? Quis neget arduis 10

sion of Arabia into Petraea, Deserta, and Felissejt may be remarked,
that this arrangement, which was made by Mega sthenes aQPtolemy, was

unknown to the inhabitants of the East. Compare Jahn’s Biblical

which we have been speaking, not merely for Arabia Felix, but also for the
Parthians and Indi.†5. Necez's catenas ‚- a pleasant allusion to the setters
