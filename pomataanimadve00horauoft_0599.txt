EPISTOLARUM LIB. 11. l. 555

Non fraudem socio puerove incogitat ullam

Pupi1103 vivit siliquis et pane secundo.

Militiae quamquam piger et malus, utilis urbi ς

Si das hoc, parvis quoque rebus magna juvari. 1¹25
Os tenerum pueri balbumque poe'ta figurat3

Torquet ab obscoenis jam nunc sermonibus aurem,

Mox etiam pectus praeceptis format amicis,

Asperitatis et invidiae corrector et irae ;

Recte faeta refert ; orientia tempora notis 130
Instruit exemplis 3 inopem solatur et aegrum.

Castis cum pueris ignara puella mariti

Disceret unde preces, vatem ni Musa dedisset?

only an amusement, a poet wishes to entertain the public, and usually
does not give himself too much pain to raise his own fortune, or injure
that of others—122. Non fraudem socio puerove incoqital ullam-pupillo.
“He medjtates nothing fmudulent against a partirer, nor against the
boy that is his ward.'’ As regards the term socio, consult note on Ode
111. xxiv. 60. Incoyitat is analogous to the Greek ἐπινοεῖ or ἐπιβουλεύει.
Horace appears to have been the first, if not the only writer that has
made use of this verb—124. sz't siliquis et pane secundo. “ He lives
on carobs and brown bread.” By siliquis are here meant the pods of
the carob-tree‚ which in times of scarcity supplied the poor with food.
—Pane secundo ; literally, “ bread of a second quality.’'-l·24. Malus.
“ Cowardlv.'’

126—1'31 . 126. Os tenerum pueri balbumque polita figurat. ‘⁴ The
poet fashions the tender and lisping accents of the boy.’' Horace now
begins to enumerate the positive advantages that flow from his art. It
fashions the imperfect accents of the boy ; for children are first made
to read the works of the poets 3 they get their moral sentences by heart,
and are in this way taught the mode of pronouncing with exactness and
propriety.—-l·.“¹.7. Torquet ab obscoenis jam nunc sermonibus aurem. In a
moral point of view, argues Horace, the services of poetry are not less
considerable. It serves to tum the ear of youth from that early corrupter
of its innocence‚ the sedueement of loose and impure communication,
128. Mox etiam pectus praeceptis format amicis. Poetry next serves to
form our riper age, which it does with all the addi-ess and tendomess of
friendship (amicis praeceptis), by the sanctity and wisdom of the Iessons
which it inculca-tes, and by correcting rudeness of manners, and envy
and anger.——‚l20. Recte sacta refert. ‘⁶ Hc records virtuous and noble
actions.”—0rientia tempora notis instruit exemplis. “ He instructs the
rising generation by well-known examples;” i. e. he places before the
eyes of the young, as models of imitation in aster-life, well-known ex-
amples of illustrious mem—131. Inopem solatur et aeyvrum. The poet
mu relieve even the languor of ill health‚ and sustain poverty herself
under the scom and insult of contumelious opulence.

132—137. 132. Castis cum pueris igmara puella mariti, ὅτε. An
elegant expression for chorus castorum puerorum et castarum virginum.
We now enter upon an enumeration of the services which poetry ren-
