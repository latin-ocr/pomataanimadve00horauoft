MAECENAS atavis edite regibus,

’ἓ Thc word Ode (from the Greek ᾠδή) was not introduced into tho-
Latin tongue until the third or fourth century ofour cra, and was then first
used to denote any picccs of a lyric nature. The grainmarians, pcrcciving
that Horace had more than once used the word carmen to designate this
kind of poetry, ventured to place it at the head of his odes3 and their exam-
ple has been followed by almost all succeeding editors. We have no very
strong reason, however, to suppose that the poet himself ever intended this
as a general title for his lyric productions. (Compare Les Poiz‘sz'es d'Ho-
race, par Sanadon, vol. i. p. 6.)

Om: L-Addressed to Maecenas, and intended probably by Horace as a
dedication to him of part of his odes. It is generally thought, that the
poet collected together and presented on this occasion the first three books
of his lyric pieces. From the complexim, however, of the last ode of the
second book, it would appear that the third book was separately given to
the world, and at a later period.

The subject of the present ode is bm'efly this: The objects of human
desire and pursuit are various. One man delights in the victor‘s prize at
the public games, another in attaining to high politica] prefer-ment, a third
in the pursuits of agriculture, &c. My chief aim is the successful cultiva-
tion of lyric verse, in which if Ι shall obtain your applause, Ο Maecenas!
my lot will be 3 happy one indeed.

ancestors.’' §ani-us Cilnius Maecenas, who shared 2vith Agrippa the favour
and confidence ofAugustus, and distinguished himselfb'y his patronage of
literary men, is said to have been descended from Elbius Volterrenus, one
of the Lucumones of Etruria, who fell in the battss'if‘ffie IERE‘Vadimona,

sweet glory.” The expression dulce decus meum refers to the feeling of
gratifioetion entertained by the poet in having so illustrious a patron and
ffiend.—The synaloepha is neglected in the commencemeut of this line, as
