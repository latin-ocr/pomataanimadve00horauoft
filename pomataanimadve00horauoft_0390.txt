garrulans man, completely misconstruing the poet’s ironical advice,
already, in imagination, triumphs over every obstacle, and makes his
way*r like a conqueror—58. Tempora quaeram. “I will watch my
opportunities.'’—59. Triviis. Triviam properly denotes a spot where
three roads meet (τρίοδος); here, however, it is taken in a general
sense, for any placo of public resort.—De(lucam. “1 will escort him
home.” This was regarded as a mark of honour, and was always paid
to distinguished individuals.—61. Fuscus Aristius. The same to whom
the 22d Ode of the lst Book, and the loth Epistle of the lst Book, are
inscribed. He was a grammarian, a poet, and an orator, and the inti-
mate friend of Horace.—6·2. Pulchre. In familiar language equivalent
to bene, and used in this sense particularly by the comio writers, as
καλῶς and κάλλιον among the Greeks—64. Lentissima brachia. ‘⁴ His

me.'’

cumcised Jews 3‘’ The ancient scholiasts, as well as the modern com-
mentators, are divided in opinion with regard to what is here denominated
“the thirtieth sabbath.’' Some refer it to the Jewish passover, which
eommenced on the thirtieth sabbath of their year. It is better perhaps to

, adopt the opinion of Scaliger, (de Emend. Temp. 3. p. 309‚) and Selden,

(de Jure Nat. iii. 15‚) and understand by tricesima sabbata the thirtieth
day of the lunar mouth, in part at least kept sacred by the Jews—70.
Nulla mihi. inquam, Belliyz'o est. “ I have no religious scruples on that
head, replied 1.'’—71. At 7125 ,· sum paulo infirmior, &c. “ But I have:
