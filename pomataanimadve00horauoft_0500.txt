458 Q.. HORATII FLACCI

Multis occulto crescit res fenore. Verum 80
Esto, aliis alios rebus studiisque teneri z

Fecerit auspicium, cras ferramenta Teanum

Tolletis, fabri. Lectus genialis in aula est ε

Nil ait esse prius, melius nil caelibe vita 3

Si non est, jurat bene solis esse maritis.

Quo teneam vultus mutantem Protea nodo 2 90

same things Ρ '’ It were of little consequence that mankind differed
from each other, if they could agree with themselves. We might

cry⁷ 'Po-morrow, workmen, you will convey your tools to Teanum ;”
τ’. e. ii the sickly fancy once come across his hrain, receiving it as an
auspicious omen, he will immediately abandon his plans at Baiae, and
will leave the vicinity of the sea for the interior of the country. The
force and spirit of the passage consists in the opposition between Baiae,
situate on the coast, and Teanum, an inland town.——86. Teanum. There
were two towns of this name in Italy, one in Apulia, on the right bank

of Capua. This last is the one here alluded to. It was famed for the
beauty of the surrounding country, and became one of the favourite

places of resort for the Roman nobility and men of wealth, who erected y

splendid villas in its neighbourhood. Some cold acidulous springs are
noticed in its vicinity by the ancient writers3 they are now called
Aequa delle Caldarelle. The Teanum of which we are here speaking,
