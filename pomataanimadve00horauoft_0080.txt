40 Q. HORATII PLAce1

Pones iambis; sive flamma
Sive mari libet Adriano.

Non Dindym‘e'ne, non adytis quatit
Mentem sacerdotum incola Pythius,
Non QQ'. aeque, non acuta
Si geminant Corybantes aera,

Tristes ut irae3 quas neque Noricus
Deterret ensis, neo mare naufragum, 10
Nee saevus ignis, nee tremendo
Jupiter ipse ruens tumultu.

lays the blame on the ardent and impetuous feelings of youth. The ode
turns principally on the fatal effects of unrestrained anger. An old
commentator informs us, that'the name of the female was Grandia, and
that she is the same with the Canidia of the Epodes. Acron and Porphy-
rion call her TyndariS, whence some have been led to infer, that Gratidia,
whom Horace attacked, was tlssqpffinh and that, being now in love with
her dfflighter Tynda—ris, he endeavours to make his peace with the latter,
by giving up his injurious verses to⁴ her resentment. Acron, however,
farther states, that Horace, in this Palinodia, inritatessstesiehorus, who,
having lost his sight, as a punishment for an ode against Helen, made
subsequently a full recantation, and was enred of his blindness. Now,
as Tyndaris was the patronymic appellation of Helen, why may not
the Roman poet have merely transferred this name from the Greek origi-
nal to his orm production, without intending to assign it any particular
meaning?

The ancients were accustomed to cast whatever they detested either into
the flames or the wama—5. Non Dindymene, &e. “ Nor Cybele, nor
the Pythian Apollo, god of prophetie inspiration, so agitate the minds of
their priesthood in the secret shm‘nes, Bacchus does not so shake the soul,
nor the Corybantes, when they strike with redoubled blows on the shrill
cymbals, as glootny anger rages.” Understand quatiunt with Covybantes
and irae respectively, and observe the expressive force of the zeugma.
The idea intended to be conveyed is, when divested of its poetic attire,
simply this: “Nor Cybele, nor Apollo, nor Bacchus, nor the Cory-
bantes, can shake the soul as does the power of anger.'⁷—Dindgmene.
The goddessq Cybele received this name from being worshipped on Mount
Dindymus, near the city of gessinus in galatia, a district of Asia
Minor. ’

6-11. 6. Incola Pythius. The term ‘incola beautifully expresses
the prophetie inspiration of the god : “habitans quasi in pectore.’'—8.
