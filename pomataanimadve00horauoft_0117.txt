repose.'’ The repetition of the phrase ad arma is intended to express the
redoubled outcries of an agitated throng, calling upon tho dilatory and in-
active to add themselves to their number. The v⁷term imperium in this

passage is equivalent merely to ublicam uietem, or reipublicae statum,
taking tesgublica in the generai sense of “ government.’⁷—17. Te sem-

per anteit, &c. The idea intended to bc conveyed is, that all things must

Some commentators erroneously consider the clavos trabales, διο. as
instruments of punishment.

to couvey is, that Hope and Fidelity are inseparable. from Fortune. In
other words, Hope always eheers the unfortunate with a prospect of better
days to come, and a faithful friend only adhercs the more closely to us
under the pressure os adversity. The epithet rara alludes to the paucity
of true friends, while the expression albo velata panno refers in a very
beautiful manner to the sincerity and candour by which they are always
distinguished—23. Utcunque mutata, &c. ‘² Whenever, elad in sordid

For-tune is arrayed in splendid attire‚ but when the anger of the goddess is
kindled‚ and she abandons the dwellings of the mighty, she changes her
