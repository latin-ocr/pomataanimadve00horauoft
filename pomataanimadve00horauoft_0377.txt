Sume V11.—A law-suit is herc mentioned fpr the purpose of intro-
‹lucing a very indifferent witticistn of one of the litigants. The case
was pleaded before Marcus Brutus, who at the time was Governor of
Asia Minor, and was making a progress through his province for the
purpose of distributing justice. The parties being named Persius and
Rupilius Rex, the former, during the hearing of the cause, asked Brutus,
why, as it was the practice of his family to destroy lange, he did not cut
the throat of his opponent? “ A miserable clench‚” says Drydcn, “in
my opinion, for Horace to record. I have heard honest ΜΓ. Swan make
many a better. and yet have had the grace to hold my countcnance.''
At this distance of time the story has certainly lost all its zest; but the
faces and gestures of the parties, and the impudence of addressing this
piece of folly to such a man as Brutus, may have diverted the audience,
and made an impression on Horace, who was perhaps present, as he at
that time followed the fortunes of the conspirator. (Dunlop's Roman
Literature, vol. iii. p. 251.)

1—5. l. Proscripti Reyis Rupm, &c- “ In what way the mongrel
Persius took vengeance on the filth and venom of outlawed Rupilius,
sumamed the King, is known, I imagine, to every blcar-eyed person
and barber about town.’' According to the scholiast, P. Rupilius Rex
was a native of Praeneste, who, having been proscribed by Octavianus,
(Augustus,) then a triumvir, ssed to the army of Bmtus, and becamea
fellow-soldier of the poet. Jealous, however, of the military advance.
ment which the latter had obtained, Rupilius rcproached him with the
meanness of his origin, and Horace therefore retaliates in the present
satim—2. Hybrida. The term hybrida properly denotes a creature
begotten between animals of different species3 when applied to human
beings, among the Romans, it designatcd a person whose parents were
of different countries, or one of whose parents was a slave. In the pre-
sent instance, Persius is called hybrida, because his father was a Greek
and his mother a Romam-3. Lippis. The disorder of the eyes tcrmed
lippitudo appears to have been very common at Rome. The offices
of the physicians, therefore, would always contain many patients labour-
ing under this complaint, and who, while waiting for their turn to come
under the hands of the practitioner, would amuse themselves, of course,
with the news and gossip of the day..——4 Permayna negotia habebat.
‘⁸ Was carrying on very extensive monied tmnsactions. ’' The allusion
is here, not t00trade, as the scholiast and many commentator-s pretend,
hut to the loaning of money. —5. Clazomenis. Clazomenae was a city
