Ridebit monitor non exauditus : ut ille,

Qui male parentem in rupes protrusit asellum 23
Iratus: quis enim invitum servare laboret?

Hoc quoque te manet, ut pueros elementa docentem
Occupet extremis in vicis balba senectus.

Quum tibi sol tepidus plures admoverit aures,

Me libertino natum patre, et in tenui re -20
Majores pennas nido extendisse loqueris :

people of moderate fortune could not purchase them when they were
first published, and when they came into their hands they had grown,
generally speaking, far less valuable. They were then sent by the
bookscllers into the colonies for a better sale. Horace therefore tells
his book, that when it has lost the charms of novelty and youth, it shall
either feed moths at Rome, or willingly take its flight to Africa, οι· be
sent by force to Spain. Utica and Ilerda are here put for the distant
quarters in general. The former was situate in the vicinity of the spot
where ancient Carthage had stood 3 the latter was a city of Spain, the
capital of the Ilergetes, near the foot of the Pyrenees, and in the north-
eastem section of the country. It is now Lerida. Those who read,
with the common text, unctus instead of vinctus, make the term equiva-
lent to sorde pollutus, “greasy or duty-'⁵ But this is far inferior to
the lection which we have given. 14. Ridebit monitor non exauditus
ἃς. The idea intended to be conveyed is this: Then will I, whosd
admonitions have been disregarded by thee, laugh at thy fate3 as the
man in the fable, who, unable to keep his ass from running· upon the
border of a precipioe, pushed him down headlong himself. The poet
here alludes to a fable, which, though evidently lost to us, was no doubt
well known in his time. A man endeavoured to hindei· his ass
from running upon the bank of a precipice, but finding him obstinately
bent on pur-suing the same track, was resolved to leud a helping hand,
and so pushed him over.

17-28. 17. Hoc quoque te manet, &a What the poet here pre-
tends to regard as a misfortune‚ he well knew would be in reality an
honour. The works of eminent poets alone were read in the schools of
the day, and, though Horace himself speaks rather slightingly of this
process in one part of his writings (Sat. 1. x. 75), yet it is evident, from
another passage (Sat 11. i. 71), that this distinction was confer-
red on the oldest bards of Rome—18. Occupet. “ Shau seize thee-”—
antremis in vicis. “ In the outskirts of the city.” Here the teachers
of the young resided, from motives of economy.—l9. Quum tibi sol
tepidus plures admoverit aures. The reference is to the latter part of the
aster-neon, at which time of day parents and others were accustomed
to visit the schools‚ and listen to the instructions which their children
received. The school-hours were continued until evening.—Aures,·
equivalent here to auditores.-—20. Με libertino natum patre, διο. Com-
