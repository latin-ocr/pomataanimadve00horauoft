XXX METRES 013¹ HoRAcE.

13. Ascmfflmc Cnonnmmc Termmn'rm.

This verse, so called from the poet Asclepiades, consists of a spondee,
two choriambi, and an iambus 3 as,

ΝΙαΞοέΙηᾶε ἅίᾶυὲε 11 Edit? τέ19ῐόῡε.

The caesural pause takes place at the end of the first choriambus;
on which account some are accustomed to scau the line as a Dactylic

Pentameter Catalectic 3 as,
ΙῑῙαέσέῙηᾶε ἅτίἱΙυΞε 11 edu& 1 νέρὶὂῑὶε.
But this mode of scanning the verse is condemned by Terentianus.

Horace uniformly adheres to the arrangement given above. Other
poets, however, sometimes, though very rarely, make the first foot a

dactyl.

14. Cnomammc TmMErEa, or GLchNlc.
The Glyconic verse (so called from the poet Glyco) consists of a
spoudee, a choriambus, and an iambu33 as,
Sic ίέ 11 diva, pmns 1 Cypri.
But the first foot was sometimes varied to an iambus or a trochee3 τις,

Βόηἰε 11 crede fayajcz‘hus. (Boethius.)
Vitis 11 implicat aribores. (Catullus.)

Horace, however, who makes frequent use of this measure, invariably
uses the spondeo in the first place. As the pause in this species of
verse always occurs after the first foot, a Glyconis may hence be easily
scanned as a Dactylic Trimeter, provided a spondee occupy the first place

in the line3 as,
Sic έὲ 1 diva, piilffins Cypri.
15. Cnomnamc Tmmaraa emmeno, or anncm'rm.

The Pherecratio verse (so called from the poet Pherecrstes) is the
Glyconic (No. 14.) deprived of its final syllable, and consists of a spondeo,
a choriambus, and a catalectic syllable; as,

Grata 1 Pyro-hc} sm> ᾶη1ίνῦ.
Horace unifbrmly adheres to this arrangement; and hence in him it
may be scanned as a Dactylic Trimeter t
Ονᾶιῦ 1 Pyrrha snb 1 (intro.
Other poem, however, make the first foot sometimes a trochee or an
anapaest, rarely an iambus.

16. Cnonnmmc Dmnraa.

The Choriambic Dimeter consists of a choriambus and a bacchius;
ἷκε,
Lydia, dic, 1 Ρέτ· ῦνηηὲε.

This measure is also called, iu Greek poetry, Aristophanic.
