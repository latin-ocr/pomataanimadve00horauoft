SERMONUM LIB. 1. 3. 301

(Quum genus hoc mter vitae versemur, ubi aeris 60
Invidia atque vigent ubi crimina z) pro bene sano

Ac non incauto fictum astutumque vocamus.

Simplicior quis, et est, qualem me saepe libenter
Obtulerim tibi, Maecenas, ut forte legentem

Aut tacitum impellat quovis sermone molestus ἓ 65
Communi sensu plane caret, inquimus. Eheu,

Quam temere iu nosmet legem sancimus iniquam !

Nam vitiis nemo sine nascitur: optimus ille est,

Qui minimis urguetur. Amicus dulcis, ut acquum est,
Cum mea compenset vitiis bona, pluribus hisee, 70
Si modo plura mihi bona sunt, inclinet. Amari

Si volet hae lege, in trutina ponetur eadem.

sano ac non incauto, &c. “ Instead of a disereet and gum-ded, wc style
him a disguised and subtle man.”-63. Simplicior quis, et est, ἃς.
“ Is any one of a more simple and thoughtless character than ordinary,
and is he such a. person Ρ ” διο. By the term simplicior is here meant an
individual of plain and simple manners, who thoughtlessly disregards all
those little matters, to which others so assiduously attend, who-wish to
gain the favour of the rich and-powerful. Horace names himself among
these, probably to remove a reproach thrown upon him by his enemies of
being a refined courtier.—Lil›enter. “ Xthnevcr the humour has seizcd
me.”.-64. Ut forte leyentem aut tacitum, &c. “So as perhaps,
unseasonably intrusive, to interrupt another, when reading or musing, with
any trifling conversation.'’—-66. Communi sensu plane caret. ‘⁴ The
creature evidently wunts common sensc.” The communis sensus, to
which reference is here made, is a knowledge of what time, place, and
circumstance, demand from us in our intercourse with others, and esp&
cially with the rich and powerful.

67—82. 67. Quam temere in nosmet, διε. The idea intended to be
conveyed is as follows: How foolish is this conduct of ours in severely
marking the trifling faults of our friends ἔ As we judge them, so shall wc
be in turn judged by them.-69. Amicus dulcis, ut aequum est, &c.
“Let a kind friend, when ho weighs my imperfections against my good
qualifies, incline, which is no more than just, to the latter as the more
numerous of the two, if virtues do hut preponderate in me.’' The mcta-
phor is taken from weighing in a balance, and the scale is to bc turned in
favour of a friend. Cum, in this passage, is not a preposition‚as some
would consider it, but a conjunction ; and the expression mea bona com-
penset vitiis, is a species of hypallage sor vitia mea compenset bonis.—
72. Hac leye. “ On this condition.’'—1n trutina ponetur eadem.
