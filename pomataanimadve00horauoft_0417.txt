Quae simplex olim tibi sederit. At simul assis

Miscueris elixa, simul conchylia turdis:

Dulcia se in bilem vertent, stomachoque tumultum 75
Lenta feret pituita. Vides, ut pallidus omnis

Coena desurgat dubia? Quin corpus onustum

Hesternis vitiis animum quoque praegravat una,

Atque affigit humo divinae particulam aurae.

Alter, ubi dicto citius curata sopori 80
Membra dedit, vegetus praescripta ad munia surgit.

Hic tamen ad melius poterit transcurrere quondam,

Sive diem festum rediens advexerit annus,

Seu recreare volet tenuatum corpus3 ubique

Accedent anni, tractari mollius aetas 85
Imbecilla volet. Tibi quidnam accedet ad istam,

Quam puer et validus praesumis, mollitiem, seu

Dura valetudo inciderit seu tarda senectus?

every luxury and delicacy present themselves ; whereas coena ambiyua
merely signifies a banquet half meat and half fish served up together.—
Quin corpus onustum, &e. “ Besides this, the body, overcharged with
yesterday's excess, weighs down the sou] also along with it, and fixes to
the earth this portion of the divine essenee, or more freely, “and
plunges in matter this particle of the dn 1n1tv Horace, to give a⁵ higher
idea of the nobleness and dignity of the souL borrows the language
of the Pythagoream, the Stoics, but particui arly the Platonists, respect-
ing the origin of the human soul. These and other schools of ancient
philosophy believed the souls of men to be so many portions or emana-
tions of the Deity.

80—93. 80. Dicto citius. Referring, not to sopori, but to curata
membra. The allusion is now to a frugal repam, in opposition to “a
doubtful '' one ; and to the ease and quickness with which such a meal
as the former is dispatched, as well as to the peaceful slumbers which it
brings, and the renewed bodily vigour which it bestows for the labours
of the ensuing day.-—81. praescripta ad munia. “ To his prescribed
duties ;'' i. e. to the duties of his calling—82. H'w tamen ad melius, διο.
“ And yet even this abstemious man may on certain occasions have re-
course to better cheer.”—84. Tenuatum. “ Worn out with tonsu—Ubi„

come upon thee ?” τ’. e. thou art now anticipating the only things
