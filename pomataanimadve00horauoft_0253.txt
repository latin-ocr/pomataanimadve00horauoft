CARMINUM Lm. ιν. 8. 213

Mavortisque puer, si taciturnitas

Obstarct meritis invida Romuli ἶ

Ereptum Stygiis fluctibus Aeacum 25
Virtus ct favor ot 'lingua potentium

Vatum divitibus consecrat insulis.

Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori :

Coelo Musa boat. Sic J ovis interest

optatis opulis impiger Hercules : 30
Clarum Tyndaridae sidus ab infimis

Quassas eripiunt aequoribus ratos:

Ornatus viridi tempora pampino

Liber vota bonos ducit ad exitus.

The construction in tho tcxt is mercedem (illius) quod bene severia—22.
Quidsorel Iliae, &c. ‘⁴ What would the son of llia and of Mars 'oc now,
if invidious silence had stiflcd tlie mcrits of Romulus ? '’ In other words,
Wherc would be the fame and the glory of Romulus, if Ennius had been
silent iu his praise ’ἐ Horace alludes to the mention made by Ennius, in
his Annals, of the fabled birth of Romulus and Remus—As regards( Ilia,
compare note, Ode 111. ix. 8.—24. Obstaret‚· put for obstitisset—25.
Ereptum Styyiis fluctibus Aeaeum, &c- ⁴¹· The power, and the favour,
and the lays of eminent pons, consecrate to immortality, and place in thc
islands of the blessed, Aeacus rescued from the dominion of the grave.u
Styyiis fluctibus is here equivalent to morta—27. Divitibus consecrat
insulis ‚· alluding to the earlier mythology, by which Elysium was placed
in one or more of the isles of the western ocem—29. Sic Jovis interest,
&c. ⁴⁴ By this means the unwearied Hercules participatcs in the long
wished-for banquet of Jove.’' Sic is here equivalent to carminibus
poetarum—31. Clarum Tyndaridae sidus. ⁸‘ By this means the
Tyndaridae, that bright constellation? Undcrstand sic at the beginning
of this clause. The allusion is to Castor and Pollux. Consult note
on Ode 1. iii. 2.—33. Ornatas viridi tempora pampino. We must
again understand sic. ‘⁴ By this means Bacchum, having his temples
adorned with the verdant vine-leaf, lcads to a successful issue the ‘prayers
of the husbandmen.’' In other words z By the songs of the bards Bacchus
is gifted with the privileges and attributes· of divinity. Consult note on
Ode 111. viii. 7.

01³2 IX.—1n the preceding ode the poet asscrts, that the only path to
immortality is through the verses of the bai-d. The same idea again
meets us in the present picce3 and Horace promises, through the rne-
dium of his numbers, an eternity of farne to Lollius. My lyiic poems
are not destined to pcrish, he cxrlainis; for, even though Homer enjoys
the first rank among the votarics of the muse. still the strains of Pin-
dar, Simonides, Stesichorus, Anacreon, and Sapph0‚ live in the remen]-
brance of men: and my own productions, therefore, in which 1 have
followed the footsteps of these illustrious children of song, will, 1
lmuw, be rescued from the night of oblivion. The memory of those
