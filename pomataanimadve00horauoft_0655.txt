sol-ming his gestures in some sort to the musio—216. Sic etiumfidibus ·
voces crevere severis, otc. “ In this way, too, new notes were added to Ξ
the severe lyre, and a vehemence and rapidity of language produced
an unusal vehemence and rapidity of elocution in the declaimer.''
The poet is here speaking of the great improvement in the tragic
chorus after the Roman conquests, when the Latin writers began
to inquire Quid Sophocles et Thespis et Aeschylus *utile jbrrent. This
improvement consisted, observesdlurd, 1. In a more insti-active moral
sentiment3 2. In a more sublime and animated expression, which, ot'
course, produced, 3. A greater vehemence in the declamation3 to
which conformed, 4. Α more numerous and rapid music than that.
which had been produced by the severe and simple tones of the ear-lv
lyre. All these particulars are here expressed‚ but, as the reason ‹it'
the thing required, in an inverted order. The music of the lyre (that
being his subject, and introducing the rest) being placed first3 the
declamation, as attending that, next 3 the language,f11c1171dia, that is, the
subject of the declamation, next3 and the sentiment, mnemia, the
ground and basis of the languagc‚ last—218. Utiliumque sagax rer-um,
et divinasuturi, ἃς. “ While the sentiments expressed‚ displaying an
accurate acquaintance with things of a useful character, and predicting
the events of the future, differed not in value from the oracles delivered
at Delphi.’' The poet here, with great exactness‚ declares the specific
boast and excellence of the chorus3 which lay, as Heinsius-has well
observed, 1. In inculcating moral lessons; and, Ξ. In delivering uset'ul
resages and monitions conceruing future conduct, with an almost oracu-
ar prudence and authority.

not to the satyrio chorus mentioned in the preceding note, but to what
is styled the satyrio drama, the history of which is briefly this. 'l'lte

however, still retained a liking for their old amusement amidst the new
and more refined exhibitions. Pratinas, a native of Phlius, in accom-
modation to the popular feeling, invented a novel and mixed kind of
play. The poet, borrowing from 'l'ragedy its external form and my—
thological materials, added a chorus ol* Satyrs, with their lively songs,
