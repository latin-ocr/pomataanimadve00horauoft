fully within his reach, with Augustus himself for his protector, and

Maecenas for his friend, too much cannot be said in praise of the man

who could prefer his humble abode on the Esquiline, the summer air

of Praeneste, his villa at Tibur, or his Sabine farm, to all the splen-

* dours of affiuence3 and who, in writing to his friend Licinius, could
so beautifully allude to his own unerring rules of action, which had
proved to him the surest guides to a happy and contented life. Per-
haps, too. the situation of his country may hare operated in repressing
any ambitious seelings in the'poet's breast. Horace had seen too much
of the instability of fortune ever to cherish the desire of again appear—
ing among her votaries 3 and, whatever we may think of the courtly
flattery which he so freely lavished ou his powerful master, still his
writings but too plainly show that better feelings were not wholly
extinguished, that at times he could recall to remembrance the lost
freedom of his country, and think and speak like a Roman. That he
could decline offers made him by the monarch, which, if accepted,
would have placed him in situations of power and emolument, is
evideut even from a single instance recorded by his biographer. The
emperor wis <hed him for his private amanuensis, and wrote to Maece-
nas in relation to him. The offer was declined on the plea ofenfeebled
health, yet without producing any diminution of his accustomed
friendship on the part of Augustus.

In person Horace was below the ordinary size, and inelining to
corpulence. From his own account, however, he would seem to have
been abstemious in his diet, and to have divided the greater part of the
day between reading and writing, the bath, and the tennis-court. He
was subject to a defluxion of the eyes, as was Virgil to a complaint of
asthma3 and Augustus used to rally the two poets by saying, that he
saf: “between sighs and tears)

His friend Maecenas died in the beginning of November, A. U. C.
746, Β. C. 8, and m his last will recommended the poet to the protec-
tion of Augustus: but Horace survived him only a few weeks 3 and
so short indeed was the interval which elapsed between the death of
Maecenas and that of the bard, and so strongly expressed had been the
determination of the latter not to be left behind by his best of patrons
and friends, that many have not hesitated to regard the death of
Horace as having been hastened by his own voluntary act. He died
at the age of fifty· seven, and his remains were deposited on the Esqui-
line hill, near the tomb of Maecenas.

’ The works of Horace consist of four Books of Odes, a Book of
Epodes, two Books of Satires, and two of Epistles. One of the
Epistles, that addressed to the Pisos, is commonly known by the title
‘⁴ De Arte Poeticass’ “ On the Art of Poetry.'' The character of the
poet and his productions is thus given by a modern writer, himself a
votary of the Muses. “ The writings of Horace have an air of frank—
ness and openness about them; a manly simplicity, and a contempt of
affectation or the little pride of a vain and mean concealment, which at
once take hold on our confidence. We can believe the account which
he gives of his own character, without scruple or suspicion. That he
was fond of pleasure, is confessed; but, generally speaking, he was
moderate and temperate in his pleasur3es and his convivial hours seem
to have been far more mental, and more enlightened by social wit and
wisdom, than are those of the common herd of Epicurean poets. Of
