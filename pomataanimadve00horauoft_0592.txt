550 Q. HOR A'rn FLACCI

Interdum vulgus rectum videt; est ubi peccat.
Si veteres ita miratur laudatque poetas,
Ut nihil anteferat, nihil illis comparet, errat: [ὅ
Si quaedam nimis antique, si pleraque dure
Dicere cedit eos, ignave multa fatetur,
Et sapit, et mecum facit, et Jove judicat aequo.
Non equidem insector delendave carmina Livi
Esse reor, memini quae plagosum mihi parvo T(
Orbilium dictare: sed emendata videri
Pulchraque et exactis minimum distantia miror.

Inter quae verbum emicuit si forte decorum,

66th line the poet admits the reasonable. pretensions of the ancient
writers to admiration. It is the deyree of it alone to which he objecta.—
64. “ Si veteresz'ta miratur laudatque,'’ &c. In the next place,he wished
to draw off the applause of his contemporaries from the ancient to the
modern poets. This required the superiority of the latter to be clearly
shown, or, what amounts to the same thing, the comparative desecte of
the ancients to be pointed out. These were not to be dissembled, and
are, as he openly insiste (to l. 69), obsoleta lanyuaye, rude and barbaram
construction, and slocenly composition .· ‘⁵ Si quaedam nimis antique,”

68. Et Jove judicat aequo. “ And judges with favouring Jove.'' A
kind of proverbial expression, founded on the idea that men derive au
their knowledge from the deity. Hence, when they judge fairly and
well, we may say that the deity is favourable, and the contrary when
they judge ill.—(>·9. Non equidem insector delendave carmina Ia’vtc esse
reor, &cz The connexion in the train of ideas may be stated as fol-
lows: But what then? (an objector replies) these were venial faults
surely, the deficiencies of the times, and not of the men; who, with
such deviatione from correctness as have just been noted, might still
possess the greatest talents, and produce the noblest designs. This
(from line 69 to 79) is readily admitted. But, in the mean time, one
thing was clear, that they were not almost finished models, “exactis
minimum distantia :⁹ which was the main point in dispute. For the.
bigot's absurdity lay in this, “Non veniam antiquis, sed honorem et

of Orbilius Pupillus, a native of Beneventum, who, in his fiftieth
