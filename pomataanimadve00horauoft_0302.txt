CARMEN XVI.
AD POPULUM ROMANUM.

ALTERA jam teritur bellis civilibus aetas,
Suis et ipsa Roma viribus ruit.

Quam neque finitimi valuerunt perdere Marsi,
Minacis aut Etrusca Porsenae manus,

Aemula nec virtus Capuae, nec Spartacus acer, 5
N ovisque rebus infidelis Allobrox ;

Fallant ,· for lateant.--Renatz·. ‘⁶ who again and again sprang up into
existence.’' Consult note on Ode 1. xxviii. 10.—22. IVirea. Consult
note on Ode 111. xx. 15.

Erum-3 xxm—The Republic, as Sanadon remarks, had been violently
agitated by civil commotions for almost sixty years, beginning with the
days of Marius and Sylla. A fresh scene of bloodshed was now approach-
ing, and the quarrel between Octavianus and Antony threatened the
Roman world with a general dissolution. A battle was expected; and
that battle was to decide, as it were, the fate of the universe. An event
of such deep interest engressed the minds of men; a feeling of uncertaintya
as to the issue of the contest, filled thern with alarm3 and a remem-
brance of the preceding wars collected into one point of view all the
horrors which they had produced. The poet, amid these soenes of terror.
composed this Epode. He proposes to the Romans a desertion of their
country, and a retreat to the Fortunate Islands, where the gods promised
them a more tranquil and a happier life. To confirm this advice, the example
of the Phocaeans is cited, who abandoned their native city rather than live
under the dominion of Cyrus, and bound themselves by a common oath
never to return.

1—13. 1. Altera jam teritur, &c. “ A second age is now wasting
away in civil wars.'' By this second age is understood the period
which intervened between the death of Caesar and the contest of Octa-
vianus and Antony. The first age extended from the entrance of
Sylla into Rome with an armed force, to tho death of Caesar. If we
make the present epode to have been written A. U. C. 721, the whole
antecedent period here referred to would be fifty-six years3 and, if we allow,
as is commonly done, thirty years to an aetas (or γενεά), the “second
age ’³ was within four years of its completion.—2. Ipsa. ⁴⁴ Of her own
accord3'’ equivalent to the Greek αὐτή-3. Quam neque finitimi, διο.
The order of construction is aa follows: Non, impia aetas, devoti san-
yuini8‚ perdemus eam civitatem, quam neque, &c.-— 3. Ivlarsi. The
poet assigns the first place to the Massia or Social War, as most fraught
with danger to the Republic.—4. Minacis aut Etrusca, &c.; alluding
to the efforts of Porsena in behalf of the banished Tarquins, and the
siege which Rome in consequence underwent.—5. Aemula nec virtus
Capuae. ‘⁶ Nor the rival strength of Capua.” The allusion, in the text,
appears to be to the bearing of Capua after the overthrow of Cannae,
when, as it would seem from Livy, she aimed at the empire of all Italy.
Compare Livy, xxiii. 6.-Spartacus. Consult note on Ode 111. xiv. 19.—
