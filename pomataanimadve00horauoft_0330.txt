290 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Moestum ac sollicitum est cantoris morte Tigelli:
Quippe benignus erat. Contra hic, ne prodigus esse

to a considerable discussion among the commentators. The explanation of
Diiring is the most reasonable. This critic supposes that Horace, having
been called by Crispinus, and other of his adversaries, “the blear-eyed
poet‚'' through contempt, now hurls back this epithet (lippus) upon the
offenders, with the intent, however, that it should refer rather to the
obscurity which shrouded their mental vision.

Smin: II.—“ In the previous Satire‚” remarks lVatson, ‘² Homce had
observed that there was a measure in things3 that there were fixed and
stated bonnds, out of which it would be in vain to look for what was right.
Yet so it is with the greater part of mankind, that, instead of searching for
virtue where reason directs, they always run from one extreme to another,
and despise that middle way where alone they can have any chance to find
her. The design of the poet, in the present satire, is to expose the folly
of this course of conduct, and to show men that they thereby plunge them-
selves into a wider and more unfathomable sea of misery, increase their
wants, and ruin both their reputation and their fortune3 whereas, would
men be but prevailed upon to live within the bounds prescribed by nature,
they might avoid all these calamities, and have wherewith to supply their
real wants. He takes occasion from the death of Tigellius, a well-known
singer, to begin with observing the. various judgments men pass upon
actions and characters, according to their different humo-ars. Some com-
mend a man as liberal and generem, whom others censure as profuse and
extravagant. From this difference of judgment proceeds aUdifference of
behaviour, in which men seldom observe any degree of moderatiori, but
always( run from one extreme to another. One, disdaining to be thought a
miser, profusely squanders away his estate3 another, fearing to be accounted
negligent in his affairs, practises all the nnjustiiiable methods of extortioni,
and seeks in every way to better his fortune. Thus it happens that the
middle course is neglected ς for

Dum vitant stulti vitia, in contraria currunt.

The poet then proceeds to show that the same observation holds good in all
the other pursuits of life, as well as in those several passione by which men
are commonly influenced. Fancy and inclination usually determine them,
when little or no regard is paid to the voice of reason. Hence he takes
occasion to attack two of the reigning vices of his time.'’

l—ll. l. Ambubaiarum colleyz'a, &a “ The colleges of music-
girls‚ the qrmcks, the sharping vagabonds, the sit-male mim'e-players, the
trencher-cousins of the day,” &c. The Ambubaiae were female'flute-

players, from Syria. The morals of this class of females may be aseer· ’

tained froin Juvenal, Sat. iii. 62. They were accustomed to wander about
the forum and the streets of the capital, and the poet very pleasantly
applies hero to their strolling bands the dignified appellation of colleyia.
-Plzarmacopolae. Not “apothecaries‚'' as some translate the term,
but rather wanderiug quacks, armed with panaceas and nostrums.--2.
Mendici. The allusion here is not to actual mendicants, but to the
priests of Isis and Cybele, and other persons of this stamp, who, while
in appearance and conduct but little removed from mendicity, practised
every mode of cheating and imposing upon the lower orders-Mimae.
