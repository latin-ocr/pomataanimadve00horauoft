This is the common Tn'meter (No. 5.) wanting the final syllable.
ξξνῃξίῐιιέἰῗῐὲε of five feet, properly all iambi, followed by a catalectic

Vb‘cciltiis ῐιίΗᾳιιὲ mm 1 morantiis az't1dit.

Liko tho common Trimetcr, however, it admits the spondeo into the
first and third plaecs; but not into tho fifth, which would render the
verse too heavy and prosaic.

Νῦηηῡῖὶῐᾶ quio-[1012 ειῖιιι Ι emnium 52 ιἰἶΙτηῦ.

Terentianus Maurus, without any good reason, prefers scanning η as
follows :

Trabanthuz εἱοΙσᾶε ΙΙ φηᾶεῘιῐΙηαέ εᾶΙνίηᾶε.

This specics of verse is likewise called Archilochian, from the poet
