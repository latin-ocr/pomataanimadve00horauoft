ease and vivacity, which only can make this kind of stories pleasing.
The object of the poet is to show how foolishly those persons act who
abandon a situation in life which suits them, and to which they have
been long accustomed, for one of a higher character and altogether
foreign to their habits—47. Ab officiis. “ From the duties of his pro—
fession.”—Octavc17n cio-citer horam. “About the eighth hour ;'' i. e.
about two o'clock. The first honr of the day, among the Romans, com-
menced at six o’clock. The courts opened at nine o'clock.—48. Carinas.
By “the Carinae'' is meant a quarter of the city so called, as Nardini
not improbably supposes, from its being placed in a hollow between the
Coelian, Esquiline, and Palatine hilis. The greater part of it was situ-
ate in the fourth region. From the epithet of lqutae, which virgil applies
to it, we may infer, that the houses which stood in this quarter of ancient
Rome were distinguished by an air of superior elegance and‘grandeur.
From the same passage of Virgil it appears that the Carinae did not
stand very sar from the Forum. To Philip, however, who was now
advanced in years, the distance appeared too great.

“ In a barber's shop, that resort of idlersl’ Vacua is here equivalent to
otiosa. With regard to the term umbra, it may be remarked‚ that
though rendered by the word ‘⁶ shop‚'' in order to suit modern ideas, it
properly denotes a shed or awning open to the street.—5l. Cultello pro-
prios purgantem leniter wzyues. “ Paring his own nails with a careless
air.” Proprios here denotes his doing for himself what was commonly
done by the barben—52. Αἴθη laeve jussa Philippi accipiebat. “ Was
very smart at taking Philip’s connnands.''—-53. Quaere et refer. Philip’s
object in sending his slave on this errand was as follows: Returni‘ng
home from the fatiguing avocations of the bar, and complaining of the
distance to his orm abode, which, though short in itself, the growing
infirmities of age caused to appear long to him, Philip espies, on a sud-
den, a person scated at his ease in a barber's shop, and paring his nails
with an air of the utmost composure. Touched with a feeling somewhat
like envy, on beholding a man so much happier to all appearance than
himself, he sends his slave to ascertain who the individual was, and to
learn all about him.—Unde domo. “ Of what country.''--56. Tenui
censu. “ Of small fortu11e.”-Sine crimine natum. “Born without- a
