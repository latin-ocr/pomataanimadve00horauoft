436 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Subtilis veterum judex et callidus audis.

N il ego, si ducor libo fumante: tibi ingens

Virtus atque animus coenis responsat opimis?

Obsequium ventris mihi perniciosius est: eur?

Ter-go plector enim3 qui tu impunitior illa, 105

Jam vino quaerens, jam somno fallere curam:

Frustra: nam comes atra premit sequiturque fugacem. 115

The train of ideas is as follows: If Ι, in order to satisfy the cravings
of a hungry stomaeh‚ lay my hands on a smoking cake, it is more fatal
to me: and why, pray P Because my back must pay for it. And dost
thou imagine that thou obtainest with any more impunity those rare
and exquisite dishes? Thou wilt pay in truth but too dearly for them.
. Those endless repasts create only palling and distaste, and thy enfeebled
and tottering feet cannot sustain the weight of thy pampered and sickly
frama—106. Quae parvo sumi nequeunt. ‘⁶ Which cannot be obtained
at a trifling expense ;” equivalent to quae parvo pretio parari mm pos-

his estates ?‘' i.e. in order to obtain means for its gratification.——-ll2.
