sufficient. What is sufficient to answer all the demands of natura—-
180. Aedilis, fueritve vestrum praetor. The offices of aedile and praetor
being the principal avenues to higher preferment, and those who were
defeated in suing for them finding it difficult, in consequence, to attain
any office of magistracy for the time to come, it was a necessary result,
that canvassing for the respective dignities of aedile and praetor should
open a door to largesses and heavy expenditure, for the purpose of con-
ciliating the good-will of the votem—181. Intestabilis et sacer.
‘⁴ Infamous and accursed.'' The epithet intestabilis, which both here
and in general is equivalent simply to infamis, denotes, in its proper
and special sense, an individua] who is neither allowed to give evidence
in a court of justice, to make a will, be a witness to one, or receive
any thing by testamentary bequest.—18·2. In cicere atque faba, &c.;
alluding to largesscs bestowed on the populace. Horace here puts for
largesses in genelal those of a particular kind, though of an earlier date.
-183. Latus. “ Puffed up with importance.''—-Et aEneus· ut stes.
“And that thou mayest stand in brass ;’' i. e. mayest have a brazen
statue raised to 'thy honour, and as a memorial of thy liberality.—184.
Nudas ayo-is, nudus nummis, &03 alluding to the ruinous effects of
largesses on the private resources of the indixidual who bestows them.
—l85. seilicet. IronicaL—Ayrippa. M. Vipsanius Agrippa, the illus—
trions Roman, having been elected aedilo A. U. C. 721, displayed so
much magnificence in the celebration of the C ircensian gamos, and in the
other spectacles which he exhibited, and also evinced such munificent
liberality in the public buildings with which he caused the city to be
adorned, as to be every where grected with the loudest acclamations by
the populace—136. Astzcla vulpes. Supply velati, or some equivalent
particle. “ Like a cunning fox having imitated a noble lion.''
187—191. 187. Ne quis humasse velit, ἃς. Stertinius now brings
forward a new instance of insanity‚ that of no less a personage than
the*royal Agamemnon himself, in offering up his own daughter as a
victim to Diana. The transition at first view appears abrupt, but when
we call to mind that this new example is aimed directly at the criminal
excesses to which ambition and a love of glory lead, the connexion be-
tween it and the concluding part of the previous narrative becomes
immediately apparent. A man from the lower rank is here introduced,
who induires of Agamemnon why the cor-pse of Ajax is denied the rites
of burial. The monarch answers, that there is a just cause of anger
in his breast against the son of Telamon, because the latter, while under
the inflnence of frenzy, slew a fiock of sheep, calling out at the
same time that he was consigning to death Ulysses, Menelaus, and
