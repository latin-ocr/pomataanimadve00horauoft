532 Q. nonA'rn FLAccr

Oderunt porrecta negantem pocula, quamvis

Nocturnos jures te formidare vapores,

Deme supercilio nubem : plerumque modestus

Occupat obscuri speciem, taciturnus acerbi. :55
Inter cuncta leges et percontabere doctos,

Qua ratione queas traducere leniter aevum,

Ne te semper inops agitet vexetque cupido,

Ne pavor, et rerum mediocriter utilium spes ;

Virtutem doctrina paret, naturane donet 3 100

Quid minuat curas, quid te tibi reddat amicum ;

Quid pure tranquillet, honos, an dulce lucellum,

An secretum iter, et fallentis semita vitae.

hate him that is of a dilatory temper.”—93. Nocturnos vapores. The
reference is to the “heats” under which those labour, in sleep, who
have indulged freely in wine—94. Deme supercilio nubem. “Remove
every cloud from thy brow‚” z‘. e. smooth thy forehead. The ancients
called those wrinkles which appear upon the forehead, above the eye-
brows, when any thing displeases us, clouds. For as clouds obscure
the face of heaven, so wrinklcs obscure the forehead, and cause an
appearance of sadness.-—94. Plerumque. “Ostentimes.”—95. Occupae
obscuri speciem. “Wears the appearance of one that is reserved and
close.”—Acerbi. ‘⁶ Of one that is morose.'' ¹
96—103. 96. Inter cuncta. “Above all ;” equivalent to praecipue or
ante omnia. The epistle concludes with some excellent moral maxims
and reflections. Horace, aster giving Lollius precepts respecting the
mode of life which he is to pursue with the Great, lays down also some
rules for his conduct towards himself. He endeavours chiefly to make
him sensible‚ that happiness does not consist in the favour of princes,
but must be the fruit of our own reflection and care, and a steady pur-
pose of keeping our passions within the bounds of moderation.—97.
Leniter. “In t1·anquillity.’'—98. Semper-inops. “That can never be
satiated.’'—99. Pavor. “Troublesome agitation of mind.”—100. Vir-
tutem doctrina paret, naturane donet. ‘⁶ Whether instruction procures
virtue, or nature bestows it ;'' i. e. whether virtue is the result of pre-
cept or the gift of nature. Horace here alludes to the question εἰ
διδακτὸν ἡ ἀρετή, discussed by Socrates, and considered at large bv
AEoehines, Socratf Dial. 1., and by Plato in his Alema—101. Quid te
tibi reddat amicum. “What may make thee a friend to thyself ;'' ι’. e.
what may give rise to such habits of thinking and of acting‚ as may
make thee pleased with thyself. Compare Epist. 1. xiv. 1. where Ho-
race speaks of his farm as capable of restoring him to himself.—102.
Quid pure tranquillet. “What may bestow pure and unalloyed tran-
quillity.”—103. Secretum iter, et fallentis semita vitae. “A retired
route, and the path of an humble life ;'' i. e. of a life that pasees unno-
ticed by the world. Fallentis is here equivalent to oculos hominum
latentis. It is not the poet's design to create in Lollius a disgust of his
present way of life, or make him quit the court to enjoy retirement.
