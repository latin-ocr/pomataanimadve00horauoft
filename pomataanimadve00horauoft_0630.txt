Q. HORATII FLACCI

EPISTOLA AD PISONES.

——-—-

Tffls celebrated work of Horace, commonly called the Ars Poetica, is
usually considered as a separate and insul-‹ited composition, but may be
more properly regarded as the third epistle of the present book3 since,
like the others, it is chiefly critical, and addressed to the Pisos in an
epistolary form. These friends of the author were a father and two
sons. The father was a senator, of considerable note and distinguished
talents, who was consul iu 739. He was a man of pleasme, who
passed his evenings at table, and slept till noon; but he possessed such
capacity for business, that the remainder of the day sufficed for the
despatch of those important affairs with which he was successively
entrusted by Augustus and Tiberius. Of the sons, little is accurately
known, and there seems no reason why a formal treatise on the art of
poetry should have been addressed either to them or to the father.
As the subjeets of Horace's epistles, however, have generally some
reference to the situation and circumstances of the individuals with
whose names they are inscribed, it has been conjectured that this work
was composed at the desire of Piso, the father, in order to dissuade
his elder son from indulging his inclinations for writing poetry‚ for
which he was probably but ill qualified‚ by exposing the ignominy of
bad poets, and by pointing out the difficulties of the art; which our
author, accordingly, has displayed under the semblance of instructing
him in its precepts. This conjecture, first formed by Wieland‚ and
adopted by Colman, is chiefly founded on the argument, that Horace,
having concluded all that he had to say on the history and progress of
poetry‚ and general precepts of the art, addresses the remainder of the
epistle, on the nature, expediency, and difficulty of poetical pursuitS,
to the elder of the brothers alone, who, according to this theory,
either meditated, or had actually written, a poetical work, probably a
tragedy, which Horace wishes to dissuade him from completing -and

publishing,

‘⁴ Ο majorjuvenum, quamvis et voce paterna,'' &c-

It has been much disputed, whether Horace, in writing the present
work, intended to deliver instructions on the whole art of poetry‚ and
criticisms on poets in general, or if his observations be applicable only
to certain departments of poetry, and poets of a particular period.
