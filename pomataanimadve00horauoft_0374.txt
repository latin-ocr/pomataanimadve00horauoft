334 Q. HORATH FLACCI

Nollem onus haud unquam solitus portare molestum.

Nam mihi continuo major quaerenda foret res, 100
Atque salutandi plures: ducendus ut unus

Et comes alter, uti ne solus rusve peregreve

Exirem ; plures calones atque caballi

Pascendi3 ducenda petorrita. N unc mihi curto

Ire licet mulo vel, si libet, usque Tarentum, 105
Mantica cui lumbos onereulceret atque eques armos.
Objiciet nemo sordes mihi, quas tibi, Tulli,

Quum Tiburte Via praetorem quinque sequuntur

Te pueri, lasanum portantes oenophorumque.

Hoc ego commodius quam tu, praeclare senator, 110
Multis atque aliis vivo. Quacunque libido est,

Incedo solus ; percontor, quanti olus ac far 3

Fallaceni circum vespertinumque pererro

chair;” i. e. with the badges of the highest magistracy.—98. Sanus.
“ A inan of sense.''

iol—106. 101. Atque salutandi plures. ‘⁵ And a crowd of morn-
ing visiters must be received ;'' literally, “ a greater number must be
saluted.'' The allusion is to the complimentary visits paid by clients
and others to the rich and powerful. These were made in the morning3
and the poet⁷s meaning is, that, as the offspring of powerful parents, he
would have to receive a large number of them-104. Petorrita. The
Petorritum, which is here taken generally to denote any carriage or
vehicle, was properly a Gallie carriage or waggon, and drawn by mules.—
Curta mulo. The scholiast explains this by mulo cauda curta, ‘⁸ on my
bobtailed mule-'⁷ It may be very reasonably doubted, however, whether
this interpretation is correct. At all events, the epithet curto, if such is
its true meaning in the present passage, has very little, as far as regards
force or felicity of expression, to recommend it. We would incline to the
opinion of those who make curto here refer to the diminutive size of the
animal in question 3 so that the meaning of curto mulo will be, “ on my
little mule.''—106. Mantica. Corresponding to the modern “ wanet‚’'
or “ portmanteau.'' Β

107-114. 107. Sordes. ‘⁴ The sordid meanness.”—108. Tiburte
Via. The Tiburtine Way led from the Esquiline gate of the capital to
the town of Tibur. The praetor is travelling along it to reach his villa at
the latter placeg and the meanness to which the poet alludes, is his car-
rying along with him certain things which will save him the expense
of stopping at inns by the way.—109. Oenophorumque. ‘⁶ And a vessel
for holding wine.'’——113. Fallaoem. ‘⁴‘ The resort of cheating impos·
tors.¹‘ According to the scholiast‚ there was always a large number of
impostore, fortune-teuers, astrologers, and cheats of every description
collected at the Circus, who imposed upon the ignorant and unwary part
of the spectators.—Circum. The allusion is to the Circus Maximus,
situata in the eleventh region of Rome, in the valley between the Aven-
