exhibiting his novel invention upon the waggon, which convey ed the

considered to have been the inventor of the Drama. Of Tragedy,
however, properly 50 called, he does not appear to have had an'y idea.
The 111-81118118 188118110115 which he introduced, were probably confined
to Bacchus and his adventures3 and the whole performance was little
elevated above the levity of the Satyric extemporalia, which these
monologues had superseded.

Up to this period, the per rformance called τραγῳδία had more the
semblance of Comedy 111111 of its own subsequent and perfect form.
The honour of introducing Tragedy, in its later acceptation, was re-
served for Phrynicus, a scholar of Thespis, who began to exhibit Β. C.
511, 1118 year before the exp11s1on of the Pisistratidae. Phrynicus
dropped the light and ludicrous cast of the original Drama, and, dis-
missing Bacchus and the Satyrs, formed his plays from the more grave
and elevated events recorded 111 the mythology and history of the coun-
try. (Plutarch, Symp. Quaest. 1. 1.) The change thus produced in
the tone of the Drama constitutes its fourth form. Much, however,
yet remained to be done. The choral odes, with the accompanying
11811885, still composed the principal part of the performance; and the
loose disjointed monologues of the 'single actor, were far removed from
that unity of plot and connexion of dialogue which subs sequent improve-
ments produced.

The fifth form of tragedy owed its origin to AEschylus. He added
a second actor to the locutor of Thespis and Phrynicus, and thus intro-
duced the dialogue. He abridged the immoderate length of the choral
odes, making them subservient to the main interest of the plot, and
expanded the short episodes into scenes of competent extent. To these
improvements in the economy of the Drama he added the decorations
of art in its exhibition. A regular stage, (Vitruv. prajt'. libr. 7,) with
appropriate scenery was erected3 the performers were furnished with
becoming 111-8558581111 raised to the stature of the heroes represented by
the thick· soled cothurnus3 whilst the face was brought to the heroic
cast by 8, mask of proportionate size and strongly marked character,
which was also so contrived asto give power and distinctues ss to the
voice He paid great attention to the choral dances, and invented
several figure dances himself. Among his other improvements is men-
tioned the introduction of 8 practice, which subsequently became estab-
lished as a fixed and essential rule, the removal of all deeds of bloodshed
and murder from public view. In short, so many and so important
were the alterations and additions of AEschyffls, that he was considered
by the Athenians 85 the Father of Tragedy. (Philost. Vit. Apoll. 6. 11.)
To AEschylus succeeded Sophocles, who put the finishing hand to the
improvement of the Drama. He shortened the 8110181 songs in proportion
to the dialogue, improved the rhythm‚ introduced a third actor, a more
laboured complication of the plot, a greater multiplicity of incidents,
and 8 more complete unfolding of them: a more steady method oi‘

dwelling on all the points of an action, and of bringing out the more
decisive ones with greater stage· NJeffect
