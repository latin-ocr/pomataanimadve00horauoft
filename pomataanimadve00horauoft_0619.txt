EPISTOLARTJM Lm. 11. 2. l 575

Plerumque, et risu populum quatit: hic ego rerum
Fluctibus in mediis, et tempestatibus urbis, 85
Verba lyrae motura sonum connectere digner?

Auctor erat Romae consulto rhetor, ut alter
Alterius sermone meros audiret honores 3
Gracchus ut 1110 1111 foret, huic ut Mucius ille.
Qui minus argutos vexat furor iste poetas? 90
Carmina compono, hic elegos 3 mirabile visu

make verses in walking along the strects. He is not satisfied with
showing that this notion is false ; he will also show it to 110 ridiculous.
For, says he, at Athens itself, a city of 11111 scanty population compared
with Rome, a man of genius, who applies himself to study, who has
run through a course of philosophy, and spent seven years among
books, is yet sure to encounter the ridicule of the people if he comes
forth pensive and plunged in thought. How then can any one imagine
that I should follow this line of conduct at Rome? Would they not
11310 still 111010 reason to ( ‘eride me. ⁹ Horace says inyem'um, “a man of
genius, 'in order to give his argument the more strength. For, if such
a man could not escape ridicule 01011 in Athens, a city accustomed to
the ways and habits of philosophers, how could 1110 poet hope to avoid
it at Rome, a. city 111 every respect so different ?—84. Hic. Referring
to Rome—85. Et tempestatibus urbis. “And the tempestuous hurty
of the city.''

87—94. 87. Auctor erat Romae consulto rhetor, &c. “A rhetorician
at Rome proposed to a lawyer, that the one should hear, in whatever
the other said, nothing but praises of himself ;” i. e. that they should
110 constantly praising one another. Horace here abruptly passes to
another reason for not composing verses, the gross flattery, namely,
which the poets of the day were wont to lavish upon oneanother.
There were, says he, two persons at Rome, a rhetorician and a lawyer,
who agreed to bespatter each other with praise whenever they had an
opportunity. The lawyer was to call the rhetorician a most eloquent
man, 3 second Gracchus ς 1110 rhetorician was to speak of the profound
learning of the lawyer, and was to style him a second Mucius. Just so,
observes Horace, do the poets at the present day.—89. Gracchus. The
allusion is to Tiberius Gracchus, of whose powerS, as a public speaker,
Cicero makes distinguished mention in his Brutus, c. xxvii—Mutuus.
Referring to Q. Mucius Scaevola, the distinguished lawyer, who is
called by Cicero, “Jurispem'torum eloquentissimus et eloquentium jurispe—
ritissimus? (Or. 1. 3.)-·9Ο. Qui minus aryutos veoeat furor iste pozitas?
“Inswhat respect does that madness exercise less influence upon the
melodicus poets of the day. ‘2⁹' The epithet aryutos is ironical. By
furor is meant the desire of being lauded by others, amounting to a
perfect madness. -91, Carmina compono, hic elegos. The poet, in
order the better to laugh at them, here numbers himself among his
brother bards, as one influeneed by the same love ofprajse.g1f I,
observes he, compose odes, and another one elegias, what wonders in
their way, what masterpieces of skill, finished by the very hands of the
Muses themselves, do our respective productions appear to each other!
