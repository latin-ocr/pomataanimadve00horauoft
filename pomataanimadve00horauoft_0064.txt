24 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Quid latet, ut marinae
Filium dicunt Thetidis sub lacrimosa Trojae
Funera, ne virilis 15

Cultus in caedem et Lycias proriperet catervas? χ

CARlM EN IX.
AD THALIARCHUM,

VIDEs, ut alta stet Q candidum

Soracte, nec jam sustineant onus
Silyae laborantes, geluque
Flumina constiterint acuto?

uf the preparations for the Trojan war.-——l5. Virilis cultus. “Manly
attire.'’—16. In caedem et Lycias catervas. A hcndiadys. “To
the slaughtcr of the Trojan hands.” Lycias is here equivalent to
Trojanos, and refers to the collected forces of the Trojans and their allies.

One IX.—Addressed to Thaliarchus, whom some event had robbed of
his peace of mind. The poet exhorts his friend to banish care from his
brcast‚ and, notwithstanding the pres ssure of missortune‚ and the gloomy
severity of the winter season, which then prevailed, to enjoy the present
honr, and leave the rest to the gods.

The commencement of this ode would appear to have been imitated from

Alcaeus .

2. Soracte. Mount Soracte lay to the south-east of Falerii, iu the
terfiton· of the Falisci, a part of ancient Etrunm now‘EffIETi Monte

Μὴ by mom sometimes termed, nt' ,

Q. On the summit was a temple and grove, dedicated to Apo ο, ο
whom an annual sacrifice was offered by the people of the country, distin-
guished by the name of Hirpii, who were on that account held sacred, and
exempted from military service and other public duties. (Plin. Hist. Nat.
vii 2. ) The sacrifice consisted' m their passing over hea s of red· hot embers ’-
without being much injured by the fine. (Compare l⁷irg1L 2272. xi. 785.
Sil. Ital. V. 175.

3. Labor-antes? This epithet beautifully describes the foresta as strug-
gling and bending beneath the weight of the superincumbent ice and snow.
As regards the present climate of Italy, which is thought from this and
ether passages of the ancient wn'ters to have undergone a material change,
the following remarks may not prove unacceptable. “ It has been
thought by some modern mitem? obs serves Mr. Cramer (referring to
L’Abbe‘ du Bos, “Re‘flex. sur la Poe'sz‘e et sur la Ρεὶηιανε, ” vol. ii.
p. 298, and L' Abbe Longuerue, cited by Gibbon, ‘¹ Miscellaneous·
Works,'' vol. iii. p. 245)‚‘ ‘that the climate and temperature of Italy
have undergone some change during the lapse of ages: that the neigh-
bourhood of Rome, for instance, was colder than it is at present. This
opinion seems founded on some passages of Horace (Ode i. 9. Epist. 1.
