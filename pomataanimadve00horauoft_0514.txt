472 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Supremo te sole domi, Torquate, manebo.
Vina bibes iterum Tauro diffusa, palustres

Inter Minturnas Sinuessanumque Petrinum. 5
Sin melius quid habes, arcesse, vel imperium fer.
Jamdudum splendet focus, et tibi munda supellex.

Mitte leves spes, et certamina divitiarum,

Et Moschi causam. Cras nato Caesare festus

Dat veniam somnumque dies; impune licebit 10
Aestivam sermone benigno tendere noctem.

Quo mihi⁷ fortuna si non conceditur uti?

and common ones, used only by persons in moderate circumstances.—
2. Nec modica coenare times, Sec. “And art not afraid to sup on all
kinds of herbs from a dish of moderate size.'’—3. Supremo sole. “ To—
ward sunset.”—T0rquate. The individua] here addressed is supposed
to be the same with the Torquatus to whom the seventh ode of the
fourth book is inscribed-Manem. ‘⁶ Ι shall expect thee.’'—4. Iterum
Tauro. Understand consule. The second consulship of T. Statilius
Taurus was A. U. C. 727 ;. whence Bentley, reckoning to the time when
this epistle is supposed to have been written, makes the wine in question
between six and seven years of age—Diffusa. ‘⁶ Made.'' The term
properly alludes to the pouring of the wine into the vessels intended to
receive it, when the fermentation in the vat had ceased.-Palust7·es inter
Minturnas, ἃς. “ Between marshy Minturnae and Petrinum in the ter-
ritory of Sinuessa.”

6—11. 6. Melius. “ Better than what I have mentioned.” Refer-
ring not only to the wine, but also to the vegetables of which the poet
has spoken.-Arcesse, vel imperium fer. ·‘ Order it to be brought
hither, or else obey the commands that I impose ;'’ i. e. or else submit
to me. Arcesse, according to the best commentators, is equivalent here
to “afferri juhe.”——Imperz’umser. Compare the explanation of Gesner:
“Patere tibi a me imperari, tanquam domino convivii.”—7. Tibi. “In
honour of thee,''—8. Leues spes. “ Thy vain hopeS.’' The reference
here is unknown. Some suppose that Torquatus entertained at this time
the hope of arriving at some public office.—Certamina divitiarum. An
elegant expression, to denote the striving to be richer than others—9.
Et Moschi causam. The scholiast informs uS, that Moschus was a rhe-
torician of Pergamus, whose defence Torquatus and Asinius Pollio
undertook when he was accused of poisoning.—-Cras nato Caesare festus,
&c The festival here alluded to was the nativity of Julius caesar.-10.
Dat veniam somnumque. “Allows of indulgence and repose.’' With
veniam supply otiandi, or else bibendi. The term somnum refers to the
mid-day slumber, or siesta‚ which will be continued longer than usual on
account of the nature of the day, and will enable them consequently to
give more of the night to the pleasures of the banquet.—ll. Tendere.
“To lengthen out.’'

12—20. 12. Quo mihi, fortuna si non conceditur uti? The order
of construction is as follows: Si non conceditur uti fortuna, quo mihi
illa prodest Ρ The term fortuna is here equivalent to Iaetandi occasione,
