494 Q„ HORATH FLACCI

Pane egeo jam mellitis potiore placentis.

ought to live conformably to nature, and if a spot of ground ·is to be
sought after, in the first 111366, for a dwelling to be erected upon it ; ”
i. e. if we would lead an easy life, and one agreeable to nature, and, if,
for this end, we make it first our care to find out some fit place whereon
to build us a house. -The poet begins here the first part of his epistle,
and assigns, as the first reason for his preferring the country to the city,
