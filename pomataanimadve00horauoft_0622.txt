578 Q. IIORATII FLACCI

Nunc situs informis premit et deserta vetustas:

Adsciscet nova, quae genitor produxerit usus.

Vehemens et liquidus, puroque simillimus amni, 12t«

Fundet opes, Latiumque beabit divite lingua.

Luxuriantia compescet, nimis aspera sano

Levabit cultu, virtute carentia tollet :

Ludentis speciem dabit, et torquebitur, ut qui

Nunc Satyrum nunc agrestem Cyclopa movetur. 125
Praetulerim scriptor delirus inersque videri,

Dum mea delectent mala me, vel denique fallant,

Quam sapere et ringi. Fuit haud ignobilis Argis,

Qui se credebat miros audire tragoedos,

the “olden times* Compare Ode 111. xxi. ll. The other allusion is
to M. Cethegus, who was consul A. U. C. 548, and of whom Cicero
makes mention, de Senect. 14.—118. Situs informis. ‘⁶ Unsightly
mould.”—ll9. Quae yenitor produoeerit usus. ‘⁶ Which usage, the parent
of language, shall have produced.” Compare Epist. ad Pis. 71. seim.—
120. Vehemens. To be pronounced, in metrical reading, vemens.—l2l.
Fundet opes. “He will pour forth his treasures.'' By opes we must
here understand a rich abundance of words and sentimenta—122.
Lua‘uriantia compescet. “He will retrencl· every luxuriancest—-ma
Levabit. ‘⁶ He will polish.''-— Virtute carentia. ‘⁴ whatever is devoid
of elegance.”—Tollet; equivalent to delebit Consult note on Sat. 1.
iv. ll.—l*24. Ludenlis speciem dabit, et torquebitur, διο. “ H'e will ex-
hibit the appearance of one sporting, and will keep turning about as he
who one while dances the part of a satyr, at another that of a clownish
cyclops.” A figurative allusion to the pantomimes of the day, in
which they expressed by dancing, and the movement of their bodies,
the passions, thoughts, and actions of any character they assumed ς as,
for example, that of a satyr, or of a cyclops. Consult note on Sat. Ι.
v. 63. The idea intended to be conveyed by the whole passage is this:
that as the actor, who (lances the part of a satyr or a cyclops, throws
himself into different attitudes, and moves his limbs in various ways, so
he who composcs verses should transpose, vary, bring form-ard, draw
back, and, in general, keep shifting his words and expressions in every
possible variety of way.

126-140. 126. Praetulerim scriptor delirus inersque videri, &a
“ For my own part, I had rather be esteemed a foolish and dull writer,
provided my own faults please me, or at least escape my notice, than
be wise and a prey to continual vexation.” The poet means, that he
would rather be a bad poet, if he could only imagine himself the con-
trary,than a good one at the expense of so much toil and vexation.
As regards the force of the subjunctive in praetulerim, which we have
endeavoured to express in the translation, compare Zumpt. L. G'.
p. 331. Kenrick's trans. Qd. ecl—128. Rinyi. The deponent rinyor
literally means, “to show the teeth like a dog,'' “ to snarl.” It is then
taken in a figurative sense, and signifies, “to fret, chafe, or fume‚'’
