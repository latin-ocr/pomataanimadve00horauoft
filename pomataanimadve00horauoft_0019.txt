CHRONOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT
or THE womzs OF HORACE.

ᾑμ-

Tur-2 order of time in which Horace gave his sex-exal productione to tho
world has never been clearly ascertained. Suetonius, in his Life of the
poet, informs us that the fourth book of Odes was added, after a'long
interval os time, to the first three books, by order of Augustus. Beyond
this wc find nothing in the ancient writers that has a bearing upon tho
present inquiry. Commentators consequently have assumed the privilege
of advancing different them-ies. Most of them agree that the first three
books of Odes were published together; but they differ as to the period
when this publication took place, and also with respect to the interval that
elapsed between the appearance of the first three books, and that of the
fourth. Bentley, however, maintains, that the first three books of Odes
were put forth separately, and one after the other. He endeavours also to
ascertain the pen'ods when each of the productions of Horace was composed
and be lays down the following chronological scheme :
