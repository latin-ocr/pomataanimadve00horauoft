EPISTOLA AD P1soNEs. 629

Quaesitum est. Ego nec studium sine divite vena,

Nec rude quid possit video ingenium: alterius sic 410
Altera poscit opem res, et conjurat amice.

Qui studet optatam cursu contingere metam,

Multa tulit fecitque puer, sudavit et alsit,

Abstinuit Venere et vino. Qui· Pythia cantat

Tibicen, didicit prius, extimuitque magistrum. ἢ 15
Nec satis est dixisse : Eyo mira poe' mata panyo .-

Occupet extremum scabies ‚· milei turpe relinqui esc,

Et, quod non didici, sane nescire fictori..

Ut praeco, ad merces turbam qui cogit emendas,

much confidence in their genius, asserts most decidedly, that Nature and
Art must both conspire to form a poen—410. Rude; equivalent to
incultum—411. Et conjurat amice. “And conspires amicably to the
same ends—41⁶2. Qui studet optatam, ἃς. The connexion in the train
of ideas is as follows : As the athlete, who aims at the prize, is compelleil
to undergo a long and rigorous training3 and as the musician, who per-
forms at the Pythian solemnities, has attained to excellence in his art by
the strict discipline of instruction, so must he, who seeks sor the name
and the honour of a poet, undergo a long and rigorous course* of prepa-
ratory toil and exercise.—413. Puer. “ From early life.” The rigorous
training of the ancient athletae is well known.--4l4. Pythia. “ 'she
Pythian sti-ains ;'’ supply cantica. The allusion is to the musical con-
tests which took place at the celebration of the Pythian gemes—416.
Necsatis est dixisse, Sec. Horace is thought to have here had in view
some ridiculous pretender of the day, whose only emm to the title of
poet rested upon his own commendatioris of himselt.- 417. Occupet ex-

tremum scabies. “Plzgue take the liindmost;'' a proverbial form of - 24

expression, bort-owed from the sports of the young.

419-425. 419. Ut praeco, ad merces, διο. The praecones were
employed sor various purposes, and, among others, for giving notice of
sales by auction. As regards the connexion in the train of ideas, com-
pare the remarks of Hurd. “ But there is oue thing still wanting. The
poet may be excellently formed by nature, and accomplished by art 3 but
will his own judgment be a sufficient guide‚ without assistance from
others? Will not the partiality of an author sor his own works some-
times prevail over the united force of rules and genius, unless he call in
a fairer and less intel-ested guide? Doubtless it will; and therefore
the poet, with the utmost propriety, adds, (from line 419 to 450,) as a
necessary part of his instructive monitions, some directions concerning
the choice of a prudent and sineere friend, whose unbiassed sense might
at all times correct the prejudiceS, indiscretionS, and oversights of the
author. And to impress this necessary care with greater force on the
individual whom he addresseS, he closes the whole with showing the
dreadful consequences of being imposed upon in so nice an affair5 repre-
senting, in all the strength of colouring‚ the picture of a bad poet,
infatuated to a degree of madnesa by a fond conceit of his own worb.
