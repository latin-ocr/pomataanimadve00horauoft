SATIRA VI.

HORATII VOT—UM.

Hoc erat in votis: modus agri non ita magnus,

Hortus ubi, et tecto vicinus jugis aquae fons,

Et paulum silvae super his foret. Auctius atque

Maia nate, nisi ut propria haec mihi munera faxis. 5
Si neque majorem feci ratione mala rem,

SATIRE VI.—A panegyric on the felicity of rural existence, in which
the poet contrasts the calm and tranquil amusements of the country
with the tumultuous and irregular pleasures of the capital, and delight-
fully expresses his longing after rural ease and retirement. In order
to give force to his eulogy on a country life, he introduces the well-known
and apposite fable of the town and country mouse.

very large.” Ita is here equivalent to calda—2. Jugis aquaefons, ‘⁶ A .

a little woodland crowning these.”—Auctius atque Da melius fecere.
“ The gods have done more bountifully, and better, for me than thiS.''
-Γ, Maia nate. He addresses his prayer to Mercury, not only because
this g'od was a patron of poets in general, and Horace, as we find in his
odes, had been particularly favoured and protected by him, but also
because he presided over all sudden acquisitione of wealth, or increase
of worldly prosperity.—Propria. “ Lasting.”—6. Ratione mala. “ By
evil means.''—7. Vitio culpave. “ By vicious profusion or culpable

invento qui mercenarius, ἃς. The construction is, Qui thesauro invento
mercatus est illum ipsum agrum quem uti mercenarius mavia—12. Dives
amico Hercule. “ Enriched by the favour of Hercules.” Sudden acqui-
sitions of gain were ascribed to both Hercules and Mercury, (compare
note on verse 5,) with this distinction, however, according to casaubon,
(αά Pers. ii. ll,) that when any thing was found in the forum, or in the
streete of the city, it was attributed to Mercury, as being θεὸς ἀγοραῖος
and if elsewhere, to Hercules as πλουτοδότης.
