perfectly dry, was split by the hcat, and the noise produced by this scared
away the witchcs.——48. Canidiae dentes, &cu A laughable scene ensues.
In the hurried ssight of the two hags, Canidia‘s false teeth drop out, and
Sagana loses her wig—Altum caliendrum. The caliendrum was a kind
of wig or cap of salse hair.

Sarum IX.—Horace describes the unavailing efforts which he employs
to get rid of an importunate fellow—a. fop and poetaster, who tires and
overwhelms him with his loquacity. Sometimes he steps short, and then
walks fast, but all his endeavours are vain to shake off the intrndcr. A
few of the touches of this finished portrait, which is surpassed by none in
delicacy of colouring and aceuracy of delineation, have been taken from
the characters of Theophrastus.

1—10. l. Ibam forte Via Sacra. “ I chanced to be strolling along
the Sacred way.’‘—2. Nescio quid medicans nuyarum. “ Musing on
some trifle or other.”—4. Quid ayis, dulcissime rerum 5² ‘¹ My dearest of
friends in the whole world, how goes it ?''-—-5. Suaviter, ut nuno est, διε.
“ Pretty well at present, I reply, and thou hast my best wishes for thy
welsare.’' The expression cupio omnia quae vis, (literally, ‘⁶ Ι desire all
things to come to pass as thou wishest,”) was a form employed in taking
leave osa person. Hence it is used by the poet on the present occa-
sion, in turning away ftom the individua] who accosts bium—6. Num
quid vis? occupo. ‘⁴ Dost thou want any-thing of me? Ι ask; before
he has time to begin a regular conversation.” The phrase num quia
vis? was another customary mode of taking leave, and is of frequent
occurrence in the comio writers. According to Donatus, it was used
among the Romans, in order that they might not seem to take their leave
too abruptly. our medem phrase, “hast thou anything further with
me 3” is precisely analogous.—Occupo. The peculiar force of this verb,
in the present instance, must be noted. The poet means, that he gets
the start of the troublesome individual with whom he has come in con-
tnct, and proceeds to bid him good byc before the latter has time to make
a regular onset, and commence talking to him.—7. Neris nos, inquit ‚-
docti sumus. “Yes, replies he, Ι want thee to become acquainted
with me; 1 am a man of letters,’' Complcte the ellipsis as follows,
velim ut nos noris.-8. Hoc. “ On this account.’'—Misere discedere
quaeram-3. “Wanting sadly to get away from him.⁷’--9. Ire. The
historical infinitive, as it is termed‚ used in the sense of the imperfect.
