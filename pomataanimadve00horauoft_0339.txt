Delectant, veluti Balbinum polypus Hagnae. 40
Vellem in amicitia sic erraremus, et isti

Errori nomen virtus posuisset honestum.

At pater ut gnati, sic nos debemus amici,

Si quod sit vitium, non fastidire : strabonem

Appellat Paetum pater ς et Pullum, male parvus 45
Si cui filius est, ut abortivus fuit olim

Sisyphus: hune Varum, distortis cruribus: illum

properly, to get before another by taking a shorter path 3 and hence, when
the context, as in the present instance, refers to the manner in which a
subject is to be considered, this verb will denote an abandoning of more
formal and tedious arguments in order to anivc at our conclusion by a.
nearer and simpler way. The passage under consideration, therefore,
may be rendered as follows ε “But omitting more formal arguments,
let us merely turn our attention to the well-known circumstance, that the
disagreeable blemishes of a beloved object escape her blinded admirer.·'
To desire mankind, as Sanadon well remarks, to examine their own hem-ts,
and inquire whether their vices proceed from nature or custom, constitu-
tion or education, is to engage them in a long and thorny road. It is an
easier and shorter way, to mark the conduct of others ς to turn their mis-
takes to our own advantage, and endeavour to do by virtue⁷ what they do
by a vicious excess.—-40. Polypus. The first syllable is lengthened by
the arsis. By the polypus is here meant a swelling in the hollow of the
nostrils, which either grows downwards and dilates the nostrils so as to
deform the visage, or else, taking an opposite direction, extends into the
fauces and produces danger of strangulation. In both cases a very ,offen-
sive smell is emitted. It receives its name from resembling, by its many
roots or fibres, the sea-animal termetl polypus, so remarkable for its nu-
merous feet, or rather feelers (πολύς and ποῦς).

41-48, 41. Vellem in amicitia, διε. “ Ι could wish that we might
err in a. similar way, where our friends are concerned, and that virtue
would give to this kind of weakness some honourable namo ;” i. ε.
would that, as the lover is blind to tho imperfectioris of his fair one, so
we might close our eyes on the petty failings of a friend3 and that they
who teaeh the precepts of virtue would call this weakness on our part
by some engaging name, so as to tempt more to indulge in it.—43.Ae.
“ Eor.’' In the sense of enimvero. The construction of the passage is
as follows ε “At, ut⁴ pater non fastidit, si quod sit vitium gnati, sic nos
debemus non fastidire, si quod sit vitium amici.”—-44. Strabonem ap-
pellat Paetum pater. “ His squint-eyed boy asather calls Paetus‚” i. e.
piuk-eyed. Paetus is one who has pinking eyes. This was accounted
a baeuty, and Venus’s eyes were commonly painted so.—45. Et Pul—
lum, male parvus, &c. “ And if any parent has a son of very diminu-
tive sizo, as the abortive Sisyphus formerly was, he styles him Pullus,’'
ί. e. his chicken. The personage here alluded to under the name of
Sisyphum was a dwarf of Mare Antony's. He was of very small stature,
under two feet, but extremely shrewd and acute3 whence he obtained
the appellation of Sisyphus, in allusion to that dexterous and cunninae
