that season of festive enjoyment, the slave nphrniels his master with his
defects and vices, and niaintains, in conformity with one of those para-
doxes borrowed from the Grecian schools, that the wise. man alone is
free. His sarcasms have-so much truth and bitterness, that his master
at length loscs temper, and, being unable to answer him, silences him
with menaceS. The fifth satire of Persius hinges on the sanie philoso-
phical paradox 3 but that poet has taken twice the number of verses to

express the same ideas as Horace, and aster all has expressed them more
obscurely. (Dunlop’s Roman Literature, vol. iii. p. 259.)

1-8, 1. Jamdndum ausculto, διο. “ I have for a long while been

⁷ listening to thy remarks, and, being desirous of speaking a few words

with thee, I dread to do so, because Ι am a slave.”-‘2. Davusne? “ Is
this Davus ?'' The poet expresses his angry surprise at the familiarity
of his slave 3 but a moment after recollects himself, and grants him the
usual license of the Satumalia.—Ita. “ “ris even so.”-3. Et fruyi
quod sit satis, &cn “ And an honest one too, as sar as is needsul, that
is, so that thou mayest think him likely to live long.” The Romans had
the same popular prejudice among them that exists even at the present
day. When any one was distinguished in an eminent degree for virtue
or merit, they imagined he would not live long. Davus therefore
explains, in accordance with this belief, what he means by quod sit satis.
He is honest enough, but not to such a degree as may tempt the gods to
withdraw him from the earth—4. Aye, libertate Decembri, &c. The
reference is to the festival of the Saturnalia—6. Constanter. “ With-
out any intermission ;'' i. e. they pursue one constant course of vice.
Davus here enters upon his subject with the voice and manner of his
master. 'I'he character of Priscus is of the same kind with that of
Tigellius'in the third satire of the first book.—7. Propositum. “ What-
ever they have once proposed unto themselves,” how dishonourable
soever it may be.—Natat. “ Fluctuate.’'——8. Pravis obnooeia. ‘⁶ Ex·
