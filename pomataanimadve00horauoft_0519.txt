EPISTOLARUM Lm. 1. 6. 47

Ire tamen restat, Numa quo devenit et Ancus.

Si latus aut renes morbo tentantur acuto,
Quaere fugam morbi. Vis recte fixere? quis non?
Si virtus hoc una potest dare, fortis omissis 30
Hoc age deliciis. Virtutem verba putas, ut
Lucum ligna? cave nc portus occupet alter ;
Ne Cibyratica, ne Bithyna negotia perdas.
Mille talenta retundentur 3 totidem altera porro, et
Tertia succedant, et quae pars quadret acervum.
Scilicet uxorem cum dote, fidemque, et amicos,
E't genus et formam regina Pecunia donat,

theon, another of the splendid works for which the capital was indebted
to the public spirit and magnificence of Agrippa. In this the upper classes
and the rich were accustomed to take exercise by walking.— Via Appi.
The Appian Way was another general place'ofresort for the wealthy and
the great, especially in their chariots. Compare Epode iv. 14.—27.
Numa quo devenit et Ancus. Compare Ode lv. vii. 15. seqq.

28—38. 28. Si latus aut renes, διο. The trajn of ideas is as follows z
If thou art labouring under any acute disease, drive it off by using
proper remedies: if thou art desirous of Ilving happily, come, despise
the allurements of pleasure, and follow the footsteps of virtue, for she
alone can teach thee the true course which thou art to pursue. If,
however, thou art of opinion, that virtue consists merely in words, not
in actual practice, as a grove appears to thee to be merely a parcel of
treeS, and to derive no part of its venerable character from the worship
of the gods celebrated within its precincts ς well, then, prefer riches to
virtue, use all thy speed in their acquisition‚ see that no one enter the
harbour before thee, take care that no loss be incurred, let the round
sum of a thousand talents be made up, and others at the back of that ;
in fine, take from sovereign money whatever she bestows, and shine
with these before the eyes of men.-—Tentantur. “ Are attacked.‘'—
29. Fugam morbi. “ Some remedy that may put the disorder to flight.”
—30. Fortis omissis hoc age deliciis. “ Do thou, abandoning pleasmes,
attend strenuously to this ;'' i. e. the pursuit of virtue—32. Cave ne
nortus occupet alter. “ Take care that no one gain the harbour before
thee.”-—33. Ne Cibyratica, ne Bithyna negotia perdas. “That thou
lose not the profits of thy trade with Cibyra, with Bithynia ;'' i. e. by
the cargoes being brought too late into the harbour, and after the
favourable moment for realizing a profit on them was gone by.—Ciby-
ratica. Cibyra was a flourishing commercial city, in the south-west
angle of Phrygia, between Lycia and Caria—Bithyna. As regards the
commerce carried on between Bithynia and Italy, consult note on Ode
1. xxxv. 7.--34. Mille talenta rotundentur. “Let the round sum of
a thousand talents be made up¹''—Altera. Understand mille talenta,
for a literal translation.——35. Et quae pars quadret acervum. “And
the part that may render the heap fourfold ; i. e. may complete the
sum of four thousand talenta—36. Scilicet. “ For.’'—Fidem. “Credit.”
