Huic parco, paucis contento, quinque dicbus
Nil erat in loculis. Noctes vigilabat ad ipsum
Mane 3 diem totum stertebat. N il fuit unquam
Sic impar sibi.

Nune aliquis dicat mihi, Quid ια ,9
Nullane habes vitia ,9 Imo alia, et fortasse minora. 20
Maenius absentem Novium quum carperet, Heus tu,
Quidam ait, ignoras te ,9 cm ut iynotum dare nobis
Verba putas ,9 Eyomet mi iquos-co, Maenius inquit.
Stultus et improbus hic amor est dignusque notari.
Quum tua pervideas oculis male lippus inunctis, 25
Cur in amicorum vitiis tam cernis acutum,

Quam aut aquila aut serpens Epidaurius? At tibi contra,

lena dedisses. ‘⁴ Hadst thou given a million of sesterces to this frugal
being, this man who could live happily on so little, in five days there was
nothing iu his coffers.” The use of the indicative erat, in place of the
subjunctive, serves to give more liveliness to the representation. As
regards the expression Decies centena, it must be recollected that there
is an ellipsis of millia sestertium—17. IVoctes viyilabat ad ipsum
mane, διο. “ He would sit up all night until the very morning, he would
snore away the entire day. Never was there anything so inconsistent
with itself.”——‘.20. Imo alia, et sortasse minora. “ Yes, I have faults
of another kind, though perhaps less disagreeahle.'' The usage of the
conjunction et in this passage is analogous to that of καί for καίτοι in
Greek.—2l. Maenius. Horace, after acknowledging that he was not
without fauhs, here resumes the discourse. I am sar, says the poet,
from being like Maenius, who defames his friend, and at the same time
winks at much greater fail'ings in himself. On the contrary, 1 consider him
every way deserving of the severest censure. The individual here alludcd
ιο is, in all probability, the same with the Maenius mentioned in the first
satire. There he appears as a worthless and profligate man. here as a
slanderer·

22—27. 22. Iynoras te? an ul ignotum, &tn ‘⁴ Art thou unac-
quainted with thyself ἓ or dost thou think that thou art going to·impose
upon us, as one who is a stranger to his own failings? '' With iynotum
undemtand ebt—24. Stultus et improbus hic amor est. ‘⁴ This is a.
foolis'n and unjust sels-love.” With amor supply saul-25. Quum tua
pervideas oculis, διο. “ When thou lookest on thine own faults as it
were with anointed eyes, obscure of vision to thine own harm.’' The man
who winks at his own defects, is not unaptly compared to one who labours
under some distemper of vision, (lippitudo) and whose eyes, smeared with
ointtnent, (collyrium) are almost closed on external objects. Pervideas,
iu the text, is used for the simple verb, asin Greek κατιδεῖν for ἰδεῖν.
As regards the construction of male with lippus, it must be obser-ved, that
the meaning of this adverb, in passages, when thus construed. varies accord-
ing to the nature of the context ; thus, male lamas is sor nimis laaeus, male

sedulus for importune sedulus, male3 ‘raucus for moleste raucus, ἅς.-
