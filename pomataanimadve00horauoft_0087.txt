The epithet candide is here very expressive, and refers to the unfading
EPdeYhich the mythology of the Greeks aud Romans assigned to the

”deity of wine. Compare Broukhus. ad Tibull. 111. vi. 1, and Dryden‚
(ode ffi'd· *Stg‘c'ecilia's Day‚) ¹‘ Bacchus, ever fair and ever young.” In
order to understand more fully the train of ideas in this and the following
partos the ode, we must bear in mind, that the poet now dmws all his
images from the rites of Bacchus. Hc who indulges iuosleratcly in the use
of wine ff'hiade sd‘entical with the true aud acceptable worshipper of the
god, while he who is given to cxccss is compared to that followcr of Bac-
chus2 who undertakes to celebrate his orgies in au imni-ogei· and unbe-
coming manner, and who revcals his sacred inystcrics tot e gaze of the
profane. ² On such a one the gingcr of the god is sure to fall, and this anger
displays itself in the infliction of disordered fcclings, in arrogant and blind
love of sels, and in deviatione. from the path of integrity aud good saith.
The poet professes his resolution of never incurring the resentment of the
god, and pra5s therefore, (v, 13.) that hc may not bc exposed to such a
visitation.—Bassareu. The epithet Bassareus is derived by Creuzcr
(Symbolik‚ vol. iii. p. 363) from Βάσσα ος “ a fox ’' and he thinks that
the garment qalled.,ssssffffapfss worn in Asia linum· by the females who cele-
brated the rites of Bacchus,'dexived its name from its liaffing superseded
the skins of sexes, which the Bacchantes previously wore during the orgies.

under various leaves.'' In the celebration of the festival of Bacchus, a
select number of virgins, of honourablc families‚ called κοινῃρόεοιΙ carried
small baskets of gold, in which were concealed, bcueat ι vinefl ivg³ and other
eaves, certain sacred and mysterious things, which were not to e exposed.

ε ipped. Cymbals and homs were used at the festivals of {hisgoddess as
