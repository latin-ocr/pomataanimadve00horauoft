24⁴2 Q. HORATH FLACCI

Canidia brevibus implicata viperis 15
Orines et incomtum caput,
J ubet sepulcris caprificos erutas,
J ubet cupressus funebres,
Et uncta turpis ova ranae sanguine,
Plumamque nocturnae strigis, 20
Herbasque, qua-s Iolcos atque Iberia
Mittit venenorum ferax,
Et ossa ab ore rapta jejunae canis,
Flammis aduri Colchicis.
At expedita Sagana, per totam domum 25
Spargens Avernales aquas,
Horret capillis ut marinus asperis
Echinus, aut Laurens aper.

the term insiyuia, the poet includes both the toya praetexta and tho
bulla. This latter was a golden hall, or boss, which hung from the neck
on the breast, as some think in the shape of a heart, but, according to
others, round, with a figure of a heart engraved on it. 'The sons of freed-
men, and of poorer citizens, used only a leathern boss.—-l5. Canidia
brevibus implicata, ἃς. “ Then Canidia, having entwined her locks and
dishevelled head with small vipers,” διο. The costume most commonly
assigned to the Furies is here imitated—17. Jubet sepulcris, &a Pre-
parations are now made for the unhallowed rites ε and first, the wood to be
used for the fire must be that of the wild fig-tree, torn up from a burying-
place. The wood supposed to be employed ou such occasions was always
that of some inauspicious or ill-‹omened tree3 and in this class the wild
fig-tree was particularly ranked, both on account of its sterilsty, and its
springing up spontaneously among tombs.—18. Cupressus funebres·
“ Funereal cypresses.’' Consnlt note on Ode 11. Σίν. 23.-19. El uncta
turpis ova ranae εαηραέηε, &c.—The order of construction is as follows:
Et ova nocturnae strigis, uncta sanguine turpis ranae, plumamque mc-
turmae striyis. “ And the eggs, smeared with the blood of a loathsome
toad, and the plumage, of a midnight screech-owl.” The ancients believed
the blood of the toad, like that of the viper, to be poisonous.—2l. Iolcos.
A city of Thessaly, all which country was famed for producing herbs used
in magic rites. Iolcos was situate, according to Pindar, (Nem. iv. 87‚)
at the foot of Mount Pelion, and was the birth-place of Jason and
his ancestoxs.-Jberz·a. A tract of country burdet-ing upon, and situate
to the east of, Colchis. The allusion is consequently to the same herbs in
the use of which Medea is reputed to have been so skilful.—24. Flammis
aduri Colchicis. ‘⁴ To be concocted with magic fires.” The epithet
Colchicis is here equivalent to mayiois ‚⁰ i. e. such fires as the Colchian
Medea was wont to kindle, from the wood of baleful trees, for the perform—
ance of her magle rites.

25-46. 25. Eoepedita. “With her robe tucked up.'' The tem
may also be simply rendered, “active.’' consult note on Epode i. 34.
