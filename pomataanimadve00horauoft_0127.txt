Audire magnos jam videor duces
Non indecoro pulvere sordidos,
Et cuneta terrarum subacta.
Praeter atrocem animum Catonis.

shade of Jugurtha.'’ The victory at Thapsus, where Caesar triumphed
over the remains of Pompcy’s party i'n'Africa, and after which Cato put
an end to his own existence at Utica, is here alluded to in language
