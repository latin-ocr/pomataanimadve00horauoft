EPISTOLARUM LIB. 11. 2. 58⁵

Somnia, terrores magicos, miracula, sagas,

Nocturnos lemures portentaque Thessala rides?

Natales grate numeras? ignoscis amicis? 210
Lenior et melior fis accedente senecta?

Quid te exemta levat spinis de pluribus una ἲ

Vivere si recte nescis, decede peritis.

Lusisti satis, edisti satis, atquc bibisti ;

Tempus abire tibi cst 3 ne potum largius aequo ¹215
Rideat et pulset lasciva decentius aetas.

avarice.—208. Somnia. Horace here ranks dreams with magic illu-
sione and stories of nocturnal apparitions. This is the more remark-
able, as Augustus was of a different way of thinking, and paid so great
an attention to them as not to overlook even what others had dreamt
eoncerning him—Miramla. The Epicnreans laughed at the common
idea about miracles, which they supposed were performed by the
general course of nature, without any interposition on the part of the
gods-209. Nocturnus lemures. “Nocturnal apparition8.”—-Porten-
taque Thessala. Thessaly was famed for producing in abundance the
various poisons and herbs that were dcemed most efficacioris in magic
rites. Hence the reputed skill of thc Thessalian sorcerers.—-212.
Spinis de pluribus una. The term spina is by a beautiful figure applied
to the vices and failings that bring with them compunction of con-
science and disturb our ἥρωα-213. Decede peritis. “ Give place to
those that do.'' There is a time to rethe, as well as to appear. An
infirm and peevish old age is always the object either of compassion
or of raillery: it is therefore the height of wisdom to seek only the
society of those whose age and temper are congenial with our own.
The poet wishes to make Florus both wiser and happier. Vivere recte
means to live contented with the pleasures that are in our power, and
not to mar them by chagrin, and the disqm'eting emotions that are
incident to ambstion, desire, and superstitious ἴσθι-3215. Ne potum
laryius aequa, διε. “ Lest that age, on which mirth and festivity sit
with a better grace, laugh at thee having drunk more than enough,
and drive thee from the stage.''
