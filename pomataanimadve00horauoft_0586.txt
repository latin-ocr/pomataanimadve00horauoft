544 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Legibus emendes t in publica commoda peccem,

Si longo sermone morer tua tempora, Caesar.

Romulus, et Liber pater, et cum Castore Pollux, ὓ
Post ingentia facta deorum in templa recepti,

Dum terras hominumque colunt genus, aspera bella
Componunt, agros assignant, oppida condunt,

Ploravere suis non respondere favorem

Speratum meritis. Dii-am qui contudit hydram, 10
Notaque fatali portenta labore subegit,

Comperit invidiam supremo fine domari.

here addressed may be said to have reigned alone, having then re·
ceioed, in addition to the consulship, the tribunitian power, and the
guardianship of public morals and of the lawa—2. risoribus ornes:
Angustus was iuvested with censorian power repeatedly for five years,
according to Dio Cassius (53, 17), and according to Suetonius for life,
(Suet. Oct. 27) under the title of Praefectus Morum. It is to the exer-
cise of the duties connected with this office that the poet here alludos.
—4. Lonyo sermone. Commentators are perplexed by this expression,
since, with the exception of the epistle to the pisos, the present is
actually one of the longest that we have from the pen of Horace. Hurd
takes sermone to signify here, not the body of the epistle‚ but the proem
or introduction only: Parr's explanation, however, appears to us the
fairest: “ As to lonyo, the proper measure of it seems the length of the
epistle itself compared with the extent and magnitude of the subject.''

< 5-9. 5. Romulus, gt Liber pater, ἃς. The subject now opens.
The primary intention of the poet, observes Hurd, is to remove the
force of prejudice arising from the superior veneration of the ancients.
'l'o accomph'sh this end, the first thing requisite was to demonstrate, by
some striking instance, that it was indeed nothing but prejudice 3 which
he·does effectually, by taking that instance from the heroic, that is, the
most revered ages. For if those whose acknowledged virtues and
eminent services had raised thern to the rank of heroes, that is, in the
Pagan conception of things, to the honours of divinity, could not secure
their fame, in their own times, against the malevolence of slander‚ what
wonder that the race of wits‚ whose obscuret merit is less likely to
dazzle the public eye, and yet, by a pecuhar fatality, is more apt to
awaken its jealousy, should find themselves oppressed by its rudest
censure Ρ In the former case, the honours which equal posterity paid
to excelling worth, declare all such censure to have been the calumny
of malice only. What reason then to conclude it had any other original
in the latter Ρ This is the poet's argument.—-6. Deorum in templa ,-
equivalent to in coelum. Compare the explanation of the seholiast:
‘⁶ Deorum in templa recepti : divinis honoribus consecrati.—-7. Colunt.
“They civilize: '² equivalent to cultos reddunt.—8. Ayros assiynant.
“ Assign fixed settlements.”

10-16. 10. Diram qui contudit hydram. Hercules, the conqueror
of the Lernean hydra—11. Fatale labore. ‘²‘ By his fated labours ς’*
