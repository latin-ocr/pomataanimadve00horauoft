EPISTOLARUM LIB. 1. ll. 497

Si pede major erit, subvertet ; si minor, uret.
Laetus sorte tua vives sapienter, Aristi 3
N ec me dimittes incastigatum, ubi plura 45
Cogere, quam satis est, ac non cessare videbor.
Imperat, haud servit, collecta pecunia cuique,
Tortum digna sequi potius quam ducere funem.
Haec tibi dictabam post fanum putre Vacunae,
Excepto quod non simul esses, cetera laetus. 50

EPISTOLA XI
AD BULLATIUM.

Qun) tibi visa Chios, Bullati, notaque Lesbos?
Quid concinna Samos? quid Croesi regia Sardis?

—Olim. “ Oftentirnes.”—-45. Nec me dimittes incastigatum, &cn The
poet makes use of this corrective to sosteu the advice which he has given
to his friend. He desires to bc treated with the same frankness, when-
ever he shall appear enslaved by the same passions.—46. Coyere; equi-
valent to confirma—47. Imperat, haud servit, &c. The sense evidently
requires haud, not aut, as the common editions read. Money rules the
avaricious man, as the rider rules the steed: it yields no obedience, but
ou the contrary chains him in continual homage—48. Tortum difflui
sequi, διο. “ Though deserving rather to follow, than to lead, the txvisted
rope ;'' i. e. deserving rather to be held in subjection, than itself to sub-
ject others. The metaphor here employed is taken from beasts that are
led with a cord. —49. Dictabam. “1 dictated3' 'i. e. to my amanuensis.
In writing letters, the Romans used the imperfect tense to denote what
was going 011 at the time when they wrote, putting themselves, as it
were, in the place of the person who received the letter, and using the
tense which would be proper when it came to his hands—Post fanum
putre Vacunae. “ Behind the mouldering f'ane of Vacuna.” Vacuna
was a Sabine goddeSS‚a11alogous‚ according to some authorities, to the
Roman Victoria, but if we follow V arro, tre same with Minerva’. The
temple of the goddess, in the Sabine territory, not far from a grove like-
wise consecrated to her, would seem to have bcen' in the vicinity of the
poet s villa. Behind its mouldering remains, seated on the grassy turf,
Horace dietated the present epistle.—50. E'oecepto quod non simul esses,
διο. “ 111 all other respeets happy, except that thou wert not with me.''

With eoecepto supply eo.

Errsruz XL—-The poet instructs his friend Bullatius, who was roam-
ing abroad for the purpose of dispelling the cares which disturbed his
repose, that happiness does not depend upon climate or place, but upon
the state of our own minds.

1-3. 1. Quid tibi visa Chios, &c. “How does Chios appear to
thee, Bullatius, and famed Lesbos? How, neat Samos?''—-C'hios.
