would not be for the advantage of Rome to be left without a head to
the government, as the vast empire now required a single chief to
, maintain peace and order ; that Augustus had already advanced too
far to recede with sasety3 and that, if divested of absolute power, hes
would speedily fall a victim to the resentment of the. friends or rela-
tives of those whom he had formerly sacrificed to his own security&

Having agreed to retain the government, Augustus asked and
obtainssepd, j'rom ,Maecenas a general plan for its administration. His

minister la‘i‘ci‘d‘own for him rules regarding the reformation of the
Senate, the nomination of magistrates, the collection of taxes, the

 

ffitablishment of schools, the government of provinces, the levy of
troops, the eqnalisation of weights and measures, the suppression of
tumultuous asscmblies, and the support of rcligious observanees.
His mcasures on all these points, as detailed by Dio Cassius, show
consummate political wisdom and knowledge in the science of
government.

Maecenas had οἲῐςΞΔῐΕ-ςρξΞε-εῐᾶ between :¹313to and Augus-tus, and
healed the mutual wounds which their ambition inflicted. But when
his master had at length triumphed in the contest, the great object of

this purpose he had spies in all corners, to pry into every assembly,
and to watch the motions of the people. By these means the impru-

formed. At the same time, and with a similar object, he did all in
his power to render the administration of Augustus moderate and
just 3 and, as he perfectly understood all the weaknesses and virtues
of his character, he easily bent his disposition to the side of mercy.
While he himself, as Profect of the city, had retained the capital in
admirable order and subjection, he was yet remarkable for the mild-
ness with which he exercised this important office, to which belonged
the management of all civil affairs in the absence of the emperor, the
regulation of buildingS, provisions, ‘and commerce, and the cogniz-
ance of all crimes committed within a hundred miles of the capital.
Seneca, who is by no means savourable, in other respects, to the
character of Maecenas, allows him a full tribute of praise for his
elemency and mildnessss.

So sensible was Augustus of the benefits which his government
derived from the counsels and wise administration of Maecenas, and
such his high opinion of his sagacity, fidelity, and secreoy‚ that every
thing which concerned him, whether political or domestic, was con-
fided to this minister. Such, too, were the terms of intimacy on which
they lived, that the emperor, when he fell sick, always made himself
