122 Q„ HORATII FLACCI

Nymphasque discentes, et aures
Capripedum Satyrorum acutas.

Euoe! recenti mens trepidat metu, 5
Plenoque Bacchi pectore turbidum
Laetatur! Euoe! parce, Liber!
Parce, gravi metuende thyrso ἔ

Fas pervicaces est mihi Thyiadas,
Vinique fontem, lactis et uberes 10
Cantare rivos, atque truncis
Lapsa cavis iterare mella.

Fas et beatae conjugis additum
Stellis honorem, tectaque Penthei
Disjecta non lenimina, 15
Thracis et exitium Lycurgi.

nothing, however, in the piece itself‚ to countenance tho opinion that it
was composed for some festival in honour of Bacchus.

1—18. l. Carmina docentem. “ Dictating strains;'' i. e. teaching
how to celebrate his praises in song. Compare the Greek form of ex-
pression διδάσκειν δρέἱμα. As the strains mentioned i'n the text are
supposed to have reference to the mysteries of the god, the scene is
hence laid in remotis rupibus, ‘⁵ amid rocks far distant from the haunts
of men.''—4. Acutas. “ Attentively listening 3 ” literally, “pricked up
to listen.”—5. Euoe! The poet now feels himself under the powerful

filled with the inspiration of Bacchus, is agitated with troubled joy.''
Both trepidat and laetatur refer to mens, and turbidum is to be construed
as equivalent to turbide. The arrangement of the whole clause is pur-
poseiy involved, that the words may, by their order, yield a more marked
echo to the sense.—8. Gravi metuende thyrso. Bacchus was thought
to inspire with fury by hurling his thyrsus.--9. Fas pervicaces, διο. “ It
is allowed me to sing of the stubbornly-raging Bacchantes;” i. ε. my
piety toward the god requires that Ι sing of, δια-10. Vinique
fontem, διε. The poet enumerates the gifts bestowed upon man in earlier
ages, by the miraculous powers of the god. At his presence all nature
rejoices, and, under his potent influence, the earth, struck by the thyrsi of
the Bacchantcs, yields wine and milk, while honey flows from the trees.
The imagery is here decidedly Oriental, and must remind us 'of that
employed in many parts of the sacred writings.—l2. Iterare. ‘² To tell
again and again of.”-]4. Honorem. Equivalent to ornamentum or
decus. The allusion is to the crown of Ariadne, (corona borealis) one of
the constellations, consisting of nine stars. The epithet beatae, applied
to Ariadne, refers to her having been translated to the skies, and made
one of the “blessed'' immortals.-Penthe'z‘; alluding to the legend of
