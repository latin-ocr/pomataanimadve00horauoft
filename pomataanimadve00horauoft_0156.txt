116 Q· HoRA'rn FLAcc1

Abstulit clarum cita mors Achillem,
Longa Tithonum minuit senectus: 30
Et mihi forsan, tibi quod negarit,

Por-riget Hora.

Te greges centum Siculaeque circum

Mugiunt vaccae3 tibi tollit hinnitum

Apta quadrigis equa 3 te bis Afro 35
Murice tinctae

Vestiunt lanae : mihi parva rura, et
Spiritum Graiae tenuem Camenae
Parca non mendax dedit, et malignum
Spernere vulgus. 40

Hinm'tum. 'Fhe last syllable being cut off before apta by synapheia and
ecthlipsis, m' becomes the last syllable of the verse, and may consequently
be made short.-35. Apta quadrigis. “ Fit for the chariot.’' The
poet merely wishes to express the generous properties of the animal. The
ancients gave the preference in respect of swiftness to mares. The term
quadrigae properly denotes a chariot drawn by four horses or mares.
The Romans always yoked the animals that drew their racc-chariots
abreast. Nero drove a decem ιῘαρὶς at Olympia 3 but this was an unusual
extravagance.—Bis Afro murice tinctae. Vestments twice dyed were
called dibapha, δίβαφα. The object of this process was to communicate
to the garment what was deemed the most valuable purple, resembling
the colour of clotted blood, and of a blackish shining appearance. The
purple of the ancients was obtained from the juice of a shell-fish called
murea’, and found at Tyre in Asia Minor; in Meninx, an island near
the Syrtis Minor 3 on the Gaetuliam shore of the Atlantic ocean,⁴in Africa3
