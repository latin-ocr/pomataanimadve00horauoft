566 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Fortis Alexandri vultum simulantia. Quod si
J udicium· subtile videndis artibus illud
Ad libros et ad haec Musarum dona vocares„
Boeotum in crasso jurares ae‘re natum.
At neque dedecorant tua de se judicia, atque 245
Munera, quae multa dantis cum laude tulerunt,
Dilecti tibi Virgilius Variusque po'e'tae3
Nec magis expressi vultus per ae’nea signa,

Quam per vatis opus mores animique virorum

aera fortis Alexandri vultum simulantia. “ Mould in brass the features
of the valiant Alexander ;'' literally, “ fashion the brass representing
the features,'' &c. Ducere, when applied, as in the present instance,
to metal, means to forge, mould, or fashion out, according to some
proposed moder-241. Quod si judicium subtile videndis artibus illud,
ἃς. “ But wert thou to call that acute perception, which he possessed
in examining into other arts, to literary productions, and to these gists
of the Muses, thou wouldst swear that he had been born in the thick air
of the Boeotians 3⁸¹³ i. e. was as stupid as any Boeotian. Boeotian dulness
was proverbial, but how justly, the names of Pindar, Epaminondas,
Plutarch, and other natives of this country, will sufficiently prove.
Much of this sarcasm on the national character of the Boeotians is no
doubt to be ascribed to the malignant wit of their Attic neighbours.—-
245. At neque dedecorant tua de se judicia, διο. As regards the con-
nexion in the train of ideas, compare the remarks of Hurd: “ The
poet makes a double use of the ill judgment of Alexander. For
nothing could better demonstrate the importance of poetry to the
honour of greatness, than that this illustrious conqueror, without any
particular knowledge or discernment in the art itself, should think
himself concemed to court its assistance. And, then, what could be
more likely to engage the emperor’s farther protection and love of
poetry, than the insinuation (which is made vn‘th infinite address) that
as he honoured it equally, so he understood its merits much better Ρ
For (from line 245 to 248, where, by a beautiful concurrence, the
fiattery of his prince falls in with the more honest purpose of doing
justice to the memory of his friends), it was not the same unintelligent
liberality which had cherished Choerilus, that poured the full stream
of Caesar’s bounty on such persons as Varius and Virgil. And, as if
the spirit οἰ these inimitable poets had at once seized him, he breaks
away in a bolder strain (from line 248 to 250) to sing the triumphs of
an art, which expressed the manners and the mind in fiiller and more
durable relief, than painting or even sculpture had ever been able to
give to the external figure3 and (from line ‘250 to the end) apol louizes
for himself' 1n adopting the humbler epistolary species, when a warmth
of inclination and the unriv alled glories of his prince were continuauy
urging him on to the nobler encomiastic poetry.

246—270. 246. Multa dantis cum laude. “With high encomiums
on the part of him who bestowed them.'¹' Dantis is here elegantly sub-
