473 Q. EORATII FLACCI

Ac bene nummatum decorat Suadela Venusque.

Mancipiis locuples eget aeris Cappadocum rex:

Ne fueris hic tu, Chlamydes Lucullus, ut aiunt, 40
Si posset centum scenae praebere rogatus,

Quipossum tot ,9 ait 3 tamen et quaeram, et quot habebo
Mittam. Post paulo scribit, sibi millia quinque

τ Esse dorni chlamydum 3 partem, vel tolleret omnes.

Exilis domus est, ubi non et multa supersunt, 45
Et dominum fallunt, et prosunt furibus. Ergo
Si res sola potest facere et servare beatum,
Hoc primus repetas opus, hoc postremus omittas.v
Si fortunatum species et gratia praestat,
Mercemur servum, qui dictet nomina, laevum 50

—37. Regina Pecunia. “ Sovereign money.'·-—38. Ac bene nummatum
decorat, ἃς. “ Α11(1 Persuasion and Venus adom the well-moneyed
man ;” i. e. the rich man easily finds flatterers, to style him an eloquent
and persuasive speaker, a pleasing and agreeable companion, &c.
39—46. 39. Mancipz'is locuples eget ueris, &Q The connexion in
the train of ideas is as follows : Heap up riches3 not such, however, as
the king of the Cappadocians has, who possesses many slaves indeed,
but is poor in monem but such as Lucullus is said to have had, who
was so wealthy that he knew not the extent of his riches. ·For, being
asked on one occasion, &co—Cappadocum rer. The greater part of
the Cappadocians were, from the despotic nature of their government,
actual slaves ; and the nation would seem to have been so completely
wedded to servitude, that when the Romans offered them their liberty,
they refused, and chose Ariobarzanes for their king. On the other hand,
money was so scarce that they paid their tribute in mules and homes.—
40. Ne fueris hic tu. “ Ee not thou like him ;” i. e. do not want
money as he does, but get plenty of it ! The final syllable of fueris is
lengthened by the arsis—Chlumydes. The chlamys was a military
eloak, generally of a purple colom-Lucullus. The famous Roman
commander against Mithridates and Tigranes. The story here told is
no doubt a little exaggerated, yet it is well known that Lucullus lived
with a magnificence almost surpassing belief. His immense riches were
acquired in his eastern campaigns—44. Tolleret. Referring to the
person who made the request ; either the indiridual that had charge of

the scenic arrangements for the occasion, or else one of the aediles.‘—45. .

Exilis domus est. “ That house is but poorly funushed.''—46. Fallunt.
“Escape the notice of.''—E¹rg0 si res solu potest facere, &a The idea
intended to be conveyed is as follows: If then thou thinkest virtue a
mere name, and if riches alone (res sola) can make and keep a man
happy, make the acquisition of them thy first and last work.

49—50. 49. Si fortunatum species et gratia praestat. “If splen-
dour and popularity make a man t'ortunate.” Species has here a general
reference to external splendour, exter-nal dignity‚ δια-50. Μετεεπιαν
