330 Q. HORATII FLACCI

concurrantque foro tria funem, magna sonabit
Cornua quod vincatque tabas .· saltem tenet hoc nos.—
N une ad me redeo, libertino patre natum, 45
Quem rodunt omnes libertino patre natum ;
Nunc quia sim tibi, Maecenas, convictor, at olim,
Quod mihi pareret legio Romana tribuno.
Dissimile hoc illi est, quia non, ut forsit honorem
J ure mihi invideat quivis, ita te quoque amicum, 50
Praesertim cautum dignos assumere prava

on this account, thou art deserving of being compared with men of the
highest rank and the most ancient families ?—42. At hic, εἰ plostra
ducenta, διε. The individua] with whom the tribune is supposed to be
engaged in argument, here replies to the excuse which the latter has
advanced. Well, suppose thy colleague Novius has been advanced to
office, although a. freedman, did not his merits obtain this station for him ἓ
Has he not a voice loud enough to drowu the noise of two hundred
waggons and three funerals meeting in the forum P It is this that pleases
us in the man, and therefore we have made him a tribune.—-All this, it
will be readily perceived, is full of the most bitter and cutting irony against
poor Novius, (under which character the poet evidently alludes to some
personage of the day,) since his whole merit appears to have consisted in
the strength of his lungs, and the people had advanced to the tlibuneship
a man who was only fit to be a public c1·ier.—43. Tria funera. The
funerals of the Romans were always accompanied with music, and for this
purpose persormers of various kinds, trumpeters, corneters, flute-players, &c-
were employed.—Mayna sonabit'cornucz, ἃς. This must be rendered
in such a way as to express the foolish admiration of the person who utters
it. “Will send forth a mighty voice, so as to drown th'e notes of the
horus and the trumpets.''—44. Saltem.. There is something extremely
amusing in the sels-importance which this saltem denotes.—Tenet. In
the sense of delectat.

45—64. 45. Nunc ad me redeo, &c. The digression, from which
the poet now returns, commenced at the 23d line-46. Rodunt.
“Carp at.”-48. Quod mihi pareret, &c- The poet alludes to the
command which he once held in the army of Brutus and Cassius. In
each Roman legion there were six military tribunes, who commanded
under the general each in his turn, usually month about. ln battle a
tribune seems to have had a charge of ten ccntufies, 01· about a thousand
men.——49. Dissimile hoc illi est. ‘⁶ This latter case is different from the
former.’' Hoc refers to his having obtained the office of military tribune;
illi relates to the circumstance of his being a constant guest at the table of
Maecenas (convictor).—Quia non, ut forsit honorem, ἃς. “ Because,
though any one may perhaps justly envy me the military advancement
that I once enjoycd„ he cannot with the same justice also envy me the
possession of thy friendship, especially as thou art careful to take unto
thee those alone that are worthy of it. and are far removed from the .
baseness of adulation.’' The idea here involved is this, that, however
justly we may envy others the possession of what fortune bestows, we
cannot with the same propriety envy them the enjoyment of what they
