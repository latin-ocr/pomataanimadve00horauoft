EPISTOLARY'M LIB. 1. 2. 485

Si comportatis rebus bene cogitat uti. 50

Qui cupit aut metuit, juvat illum sic domus et res,
Ut lippum pictae tabulae, fomenta podagrum,
Auriculas citharae collecta sorde dolentes.
Sincerum est nisi vas, quodcunque infundis, acescit.
Sperne voluptates; nocet emta dolore voluptas. 55
Semper avarus eget3 certum voto pete finem.
Invidus alterius macrescit rebus opimis:
Invidia Siculi non invenere tyranni
Majus tormentum. Qui non moderabitur irae,
Infectum volet esse, dolor quod suaserit amens, 60
Dum poenas odio per vim festinat inulto.

Fingit equum tenera docilem cervice magister

of by the ancient physicians among the remedies for the gout, though
but little real good was effected by thern. 'l'he disorder in question
proceeds from such an inward sharpness of humours, as no outward
remedies can correct. We must regulate our whole course of life in
hopes of a cum—53. Auriculas citharae collecta sorde dolentes. “ The
tonoe of the lyre, ears that labour with collected filth.'’—Dolentes is
here equivalent to Male se habentes—54. sincerum est nisi vas, διο.
The idea intended to be conveyed is this: Unlcss the mind is pure, and

55—70. 55. Emta dolore. “When purchased with pain ;'' i. e.
when so purchased that pain follows after it.-56. Certum voto pete
finem. “ Seek a certain limit for thy wishes ;’' i. e. set a fixed limit to
thy wishes—58. Siculi tyranni,· alluding to Phalaris and Dionysius
the elder in particular.-—60. Dolor quod suaserit amens. “ Which mad
resentment shall have prompted.’*—61. Dum poenas odio per vim festi-
