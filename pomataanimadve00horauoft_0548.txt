506 Q. HORATH FLACCI

EPISTOLA XIV.
AD VILLICUM SUUM.

Vnum: silvarum et mihi me reddentis agelli,

Quem tu fastidis, habitatum quinque focis, et

Quinque bonos solitum Variam dimittere patres3
Certemus, spinas animone ego fortius, an tu

Evellas agro, et melior sit Horatius an reS. 5
Me quamvis Lamiae pietas et cura moratur⁷

dataque frangas. “ Take care lest thou stumble, and injure the things
entmsted to thy care.” Mandata refers either to carmina or uolumina
understood, unless we suppose the allusion to be either to the cases in
which the rolls were put, or the umbilici around which they were folded.

EPISTLE XIV.—The poet, in this epistle, gives us the picture of an
unsteady mind. His farm was commonly managed by a master-servant,
who was a kind of overseer or steward, and as such had the whole care
of it entrusted to him in his master's absence. The office was at this
time filled by one who had formerly been in the lowest station of his
slaves at Rome, and, weary of that bondage, had earnestly desired to be
sent to this employment in the country, Now, however, that ne had
obtained his wish, he was disgusted with a life so laborious and solitary,
and wanted to be restored to his former condition. The poet, in the
mean time, who was detained at Rome by his concern for a friend who
mom-ned the loss of his brother, and had no less impatience to get into
the country than his steward to be in town, writes him this epistle‚ to
correct his ineonstancy, and to make him ashamed of complaim'ng that
he was unhappy in a place which afforded so much delight to his master,
who thought he never had any real enjoyment as long as he was absent
from it.

1—9. 1. Villice silvarum, &c. ‘⁴ Steward of my woods, and of the
little farm that always restores me to myself.” The villicus was usually
of serw'le condition.—-·2. Habitatum quinque focis, διο. “ Though occu-
pied by five dwellings, and accustomed to send five honest heads of tami-
lies to Varia.” The poet merely wishes by the expression quinque bonos
solitum, διο. to add still more precision to the phrase habitatum quinque
focis in the second verse. His farm contained on it five families, and
the fathers 01· heads of these families were aceustomffl, as osten as their
private affairs or a wish to dispose of their commodities called them
thither, to go to the neighbouriug town of Varia. In this way he strives
‘to remind the individual whom he addresseS, that the farm in question,
though small in itselt‘, was yet, as far as regarded the living happily upon
it, sufficiently extensive—4. Spimzs animo ,- a metaphorical allusion to
the eradicating of cares and anxieties from the mind.—-5. Et melior sit
Horatius αη res. ‘⁶ And whether Horace or his farm be in the better
condition.''—6. Lamiae pietas et cura. “ My affection and concern for
Lamia.'' The reference is to Q. AElius Lamia, an intimate friend of
the poet. Compare Ode i. ‘Za—Me moratur. ‘⁶ Detain me hete,’'
