Aut ursum aut pugiles: his nam plebecula gaudet.

reficit. “ Overthrows and raises up again.”— Valeat res ludicra. “ F are-
well to the stage ;” 2'. e. to the task of dramatic composition.-181.
Palma negata. The poet here borrows the lauguage of the games3
so also in reducta—182. Saepe etiam audacem suyat hoc terretque
po'e'tam, διο. The poet has just shown, that the comic writers so little
regarded fame and the praise of good *writing, as to make it the ordi-
nary topic of their ridicule, representing it as the mere illusion of vanity
and the infirmity of weak minds, to be caught by so empty and un-
substantial a benefit. Though were any one, he now adds, in defiance
of public ridicule, so dariny as frankly to avow and submit himself to
this generous motive, yet one thing remained to check and weaken
the vigour of his emulation. This (from line 182 to 187) was the
folly aud ill taste of the undiscerning multitude. These, by their
rude clamours‚ and the authority of their numbers, were enough to
dishearten the most intrepid genius ; when, after all his endeavours to
reap the glory of a finished production, the action was almost sure to
be broken in upon and mangled by the shows of wild beasts and gla-
diators ; those dear delights, which the Romans, it seems, prized much
above the highest pleasures of the drama. Nay, the poet's ease was still
more desperate ; for it was not the untutored rabble alone that gave
countenance to these illiberal sports 3 even rank and quality, at Rome,
debased itself in showing the strongest predjlection for these shows,
and was as ready as the populace to prefer the uninstructing pleasures
of the eye to those of the ear. ‘⁶ Equitis quoque jam miyravit ab aure
voluptas,” Sic, And because this barbarity of taste had contributed
more than any thing else to deprave the poetry of the stage, and
discourage able writers from studying its perfection, what follows, from
line 189 to 207, is intended as a satire upon this madness, this admira-
tion of pomp and spectaele, this senseless applause bestowed upon the
mere decorations of the scene, and the stage-tricks of the day: all which
were more surely calculated to elicit the approbation of an audience,
than the utmost regard, on the part of the poet, either to justness o'f
desig-n or beauty of execution.

111 this and the succeeding line the poet draws a brief but most faith-
ful picture of the Roman plebs.—-185. Eques. The Equites, as a better
educated class, are here opposed to the Plebeians.-—186. Aut ursum
ant puyz'les. This was before the erection of amphitheatres. The first
amphitheatre was erected by Statilius Taurus, in the reign of Augustus.
