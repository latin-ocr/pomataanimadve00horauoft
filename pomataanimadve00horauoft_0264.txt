224 Q. HORATII FLACCI

- OARMEN XIV.
AD AUGUSTUM.

QUAE cura Patrum, quaeve Quiritium,
Plenis honorum muneribus tuas,
Auguste, virtutes in aevum
Per titulos memoresque fastos

Aeternet Ζ O, qua sol habitabiles 5
Illustrat oras, maxime principum 3
Quem legis expertes Latinae
Vindelici didicere nuper,

Quid Marte posses, Milite nam tuo
Drusus Genaunes, implacidum genus, 10
Breunosque veloces, et arces
Alpibus impositas tremendis,

ODE XIV-We have already stated, in the Introductory Remarks to
the fourth Ode of the present Book, that Horace had been directed by
Augustus to celebrate in song the victories of Drusus and Tiberius. The
piece to which we have alluded is devoted, in consequence, to the praises
of the former3 the present one, to those of the latter of the two princes.
In both productions, however, the art of the poet is shown in ascribing
the success of the two brothers to the wisdom and fostering counsels of
Augustus himself.

1—15. 1. Quae cura Patrum, &c. ‘⁴ What care on the part of the
Famem, or what on the part of the Roman people at large, can, by offer-
ings rich with honours, perpetuate to the latest ages, O Augustus, the
remembrance of thy virtues, in public inscriptions and recording annals ἓ ”
—2. fllaueribuae alluding to the various public monuments, decrees,
&c., proceeding from a grateful people.—-4. Titulos. The reference is to
public inscriptions of every kind, as well on the pedestals of statues, as on
arches, triumphal monuments, coins, &c.-—I‡Iemoresque fastos. Consult
note on Ode 111. xvii. 4.-5. Aeternet. Varro, as quoted by Nonius,
(ii. 57,) uses this same verb3 “Litteris aa laudibus aeternare.”-7.
Quem leyz's eoepertes Latinae, διο. “ Whom the Vindelici, free before
from Roman sway, lately learned what thou couldst do in war.’' Or,
more freely and intelligibly, ‘¹ VVhose power in war the Vindelici‚ss&c.

idiom.—8. Vindelici. consult note on Ode 1v. iv. 18.—10. Genaunes,
implacidum =venus, Breunosque veloces. The poet here substitutes
for the Raeti aud Vindelici of the fourth Ode, the Genauni and Breuni,
Alpine nations dwclling in their vicinity‚ and allied to them in war. This
is done apparently with the view of amplifying the victories of the young
Neros, by increasing the number of the conquered natione. The Genauni
and Breuni occupied the Val d' Ayno and Val Braunia, to the east and
north-east of the Layo Μαρρέονε. (Lacus Verbanus.)—13. Dejeoit acer
plus vice simplici. “ More than once bravely overthrew.”—l4. Major
