Ille terrarum mihi praeter omnes

Angulus ridet, ubi non Hymetto

Mella decedunt, viridique certat 15
Bacca Venafro.

Ver ubi longum tepidasque praebet
Jupiter brumas, et amicus Aulon
F ertili Baccho minimum Falernis
Invidet uvis. 20

Ille te mecum locus et beatae

Postulant arces: ibi tu calentem

Debita sparges lacrima favillam
Vatis amici.
