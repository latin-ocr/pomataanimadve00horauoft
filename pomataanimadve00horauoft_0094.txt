lxmam vitae scelerisque purus

Ουτ-Δ xxm—It was a very prominent feature in the popular belief of
antiquity, that poete formed a class of men peculiarly under the proter-tion
of the god33 since, wholly eugrossed by subjecte of a light and pleasing
nature, no deeds of xiolcnce, and no acts of fraud or perjury, could ever
be laid to their charge. Horace, having escaped imminent danger, writes
the present ode in allusion to this belief. The innocent man, exclaims the
hard, is shielded from peril² wherever he may be, by his own purity of life
aud conduct. (The “ innocent man,’' is here only another name fo oet.
The nature of the danger freni which he had been rescued is next de:
scribed 3 and the ode concludes with the declaration, that his an inteQ'tg
will Wffl'd off eyery evil, in whatever quarter of the world his lot may be
cast, and will render him :it the same time tranquil in mind, and ever dis-
posed to celebrate the praises of his Lalage. '

The ode is addressed to Aristius Fuscus, to whom the tenth Epistle of
the First Book is inscribed.

1—5. l. Integer vitae, διο. “ The man of upright life, and free
from guilt.''—2. Mauris jaculis ‚· for Blauritanicis jaculis. The na-
tives of n'iauntania were distinguished for their skill in darting the javelin,
the frequent use of this weapon being required against the wild beasts
which infested their country—5. Syrtes aestuosas. “The burm-'Eg
sanes of Africa.” The allusion here is Q to the two remarkable quiek-
sanda or gulfs on the coast of Africa, commonly known by the name of
the Gir-atei· and Smaller Syrtes² §now the gulfs of Sidrst and Cabes‚) but
to the inland reffl'on. There is nothing hostile to this acceptation of the
term Syrtis in the etymology commonly assigned to it. For if it be
deduced, as most maintain, from the Qreek σύρω, “ traho? the name
will be equally applicable to the st'u'l s of the guis-affl'tated bx the wayes.
and to those of the more inland parts driven to and fro by the violence
of the winds. It remains to be seen, however, whether the word in
question be not of indigenous origin, since the name Seri is applied at
the present day y t e natives, not only to the sandy region along the
coast, but also to the desert immediately south of it; and, according to
modern trassessers, the term likeuise exists in Arabio in the sense of a

desert >tract of country. (Compare Ritter's We, vol. i. p. 9-29,
..d cd.
