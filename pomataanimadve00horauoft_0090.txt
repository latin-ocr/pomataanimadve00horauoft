Conditum levi, datus in theatro
Quum tibi plausus,

quoniam aquam habeant.⁷'--16. Blactata hostia. Tacitusinforms us,
(Hist. 2,) that it was nnlawfnl for any blood to be shed on the altar of
ihc Paphiam Venus, ‘⁴ Sanyuinem arae offundere vetitum ‚·¹’ and hence
Catullus (lxvi. 91.) may be explained: “ Placabis sestis luminibus
Venerem >sanguinis eoepertemff' It would appear, however, from other
authorities, especially Martial (ix. 91), that animal sacrifices in honour of
this goddess, and for the purpose of inspecting t e entrails in order to
ascertain her will, were not nusi-effluent. The very historiam, indeed, from
whom we have just given a passage, clearly proves this to have been the
,Δ case. (Tacit. l. c.) ‘⁴ Hostiae, ut quisque vovit, sed mares deliyuntur.
Certissima fides haedorum fibris.'' The apparent contradiction into
which Tacitus falls may easily be explained away, if we refer the expression
‘³ sanquinem arae offundere vetitum '² not to the total absence of
victims, bnt merely to the altar of the goddess being kept untouched by
Κ their blood. The sacrifices usually offered to Venus would seem to have

white oats and swine with libations of wine, igi—lli, and honey. The
language of Virgil, in describing her altars, is m accordancejomewhat
with that of Catullus : “ Tlture calent arae, sertisque recentibus halant.'’
(Aen. i. 417.)

One XX.—-Addressed to Maecenas, who had signified to the poet his
intention of spcnding a few days with him at his Sabine farm. Horace
warns him, that lie is not to expect the generous wine which lie has been
accustomed to quaff at home3 and yet, while depreciating the quality of
that which his own humble roof affords, he mentions a circumstance respect-
iug its age, Which could not but prove peculiarly gratis-ring to his patron and
intended guest.

vase for holding wine, from v'nich the liquor was transferred to the drinking
cupa. It derived its name, according to most authorities, from its being
made to resemble a beetle ἑκάνθαροξ). Some, however, deduce the
appellation from a certain ant larus, who was the ‘inventor of the

testa, or ‘⁵ jar,'' derived its name from having been subjwted, when first
‘made, to the action of firc (testa nasi tosta, a torreo). The vessels
