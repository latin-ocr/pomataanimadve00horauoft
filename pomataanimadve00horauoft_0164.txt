GARMEN XX.

AD M AECENATEM.

NON usitata, non tenui ferar
Penna biformis per liquidum aethera
Vates : neque in terris morabor
Longius : invidiaque major
Urbes relinquam. N on ego pauperum 5
Sanguis parentum, non ego, quem vocas
Dilecte, Maecenas, obibo,
Nec Stygia cohibebor unda.

J am jam residunt eruribus asperae⁴
Pelles 3 et album mutor in alitem 10
Superna: nascunturque leves
Per digitos humerosque plumae.

J am Daedaleo notior Icaro
Visam gementis litora Bospori,
Syrtesque Gaetulas canorus 15
Ales Hyperboreosque campos. '

One XX.-—T11e hard presages his own immortality. Transformed inm a

swan, he will soar away from the abodes of men, nor need the empty

die.” The reading of this paragraph is much contested. According to
that adopted in our text, the meaning of the poet is, that the friendship
of Maecenas will be ene of his surest passports to the praises of posterity.
-7, Dilecte is taken, as the grammatians call it, materially.-—9. Jam
jam residunt, &c. “ Now, even now, the rougl] skin is settling on my

ot* a swan.—-ll. Superna. “Above.” The neuter of the adjective used
adverbially. Quod ad superna corporis ‘membra attinet.—R⁷ascuntur—
que leves plumae. ‘⁴ And the downy plumage is forming. ’'—14. Bospori.
