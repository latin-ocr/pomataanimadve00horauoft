86 Q. nonA'rn FLACCI

Tractas, et incedis per ignes
Suppositos cineri doloso.

Paullum severae Musa tragoediae
Desit theatris: mox, ubi publicas 10
Res ordinaris, grande munus
Cecropio repetes cothurno,

Insigne moestis praesidium reis
Et consulenti Pollio curiae,
Cui laurus aeternos honores 15
Dalmatico peperit triumpho.

-Jam nune minaci murmure cornuum
Perstringis aures: jam litui strepunt :
Jam fulgor armorum fugaces
Terret equos equitumque vultus. 20

Opus is applied by some‚ though less correcssy, we conceive, to the civil
war melfi-The metaphor of the poet is borrowed from the Roman games
of chance.

8—-1‘2, 8, Cinerz'. The dative put by a Graecism for the amative.—
9. Paullum severae, ἃς. “ Let the Muse of dignified tragedy be absent
for a while from our theatres,” i. e. suspcnd for a season thy labours in
the field of tragic composition—The Muse of Tragedy is Melpomene, who
presided also over lyric verse. Compare Explanatory Notes, Ode 1. xxiv.
3.—-10. Um· publicas res ordinaris. “ When thou hast completed the
history of our public affairs.’' Thc phrase may also be rendered, ‘· then
thou hast settled our public affairs‚'’ i. e. when in the order of thy narra-
tive thou hast brought the history of our country down to the present period
of tranquillity and repose. The former interpretation is less poetic indeed,
but in every other point of view decidedly preferable—ll. Grande mu-
nus, &c. ‘⁴ Thou wilt resume the important task with all thc dignity of
the Athenian tragic style‚’' asse. thou wilt return to thy labours in the walks
of tragedy‚ and rival, as thou hast already done, the best efforts of the
dramatic pocts of Greece. The cothurnus (κόθορνος) is here put figura-
tively for tragedy.—l2. Cecropio ‚· equivalent to Attico, and alluding to
Cecrops as the founder of Athens.

13—23. 13. Insigne moestis, ἃς. “ Distinguished source οξ aid to
the sorrowful accused.'' Alluding ιο his abilities as an advocate.—]4.
consulenti curiae. “ To the senate asking thy advice.'’ It was the
duty of the consul οι· presiding magistrate to ask the opinions of the
individua] senators (consulere senatum). Here, however, the poet very
beautifully assigus to the senate itself the office of him who presided
over their deliberatione, and in making them ask the individua] opinion
of Pollio, represents them as following with implicit confidence his
directing and counsclling voice—16. Dalm-alif? triumpho. Pollio tri-
umphed A. U. C. 715. over the Parthini, an Illyri-an race in the vicimiy
of Epidamnus.-17. Jam mmo minaci, διε. The poet fancies himself«.
