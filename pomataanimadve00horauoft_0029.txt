METRES OF HoRAeE. XXV

The pure imnbic, however, was rarely used. This seems to have been
owing partly to the very great difficulty of producing any considerable
number of good verses, and partly to the wish of giving to the verse a
greater degree of weight and dignity. In consequence of this, the spondeo
was allowed to take the place of the iambus in the first, third, and fifth
feet*. The admission of the spondee paved the way for other innovations.
Thus, the double time of one long syllable was divided into two single
times, or two short syllables. Hence, sor the iambus, of three times, was
substituted a tribrach, in every station except the sixth, because there the
final syllable being lengthened by the longer pause at the terminatior.
of the line, a tribrach would, in fact, be equal to au arnapam, containing
four times instead of three. For the spondeo, of four times, was sub-
stituted a dactyl or an anapaest, and, sometimes, in the first station, a
proceleusmaticus.

The scale of the mixed Iambic Triineter is therefore as follows-l· ;

been originally used in satirical composition. Lennep makes it the
same with ἵαβσς, and deduces this last from ἷάω; the same as ἴω, “to
throw at.’'

* The reason κὼς the Iambus was retained in the even places, that is,
the second, fourth, and sixti), appears to have been this3 that by placing
the spondee first, and making the iambus to follow, greater emphasis was
given to the concluding syllable of each measure, on which the ictus and
pause took place, than would have been the case had two long syllables
stood together. Vide Car-ey’s Latin Prosody, p. 259, ed. 1819,——whcre
other particulars will be found relative to the Trimeter Iambic measure,
as used by the Latin writers of Tragedy, Comedy, and Fable.

† The scale of the Greek Trimeter Iambic must not be confoundcd
with this. Rorson (Praes- ad Hec. 6.) has denied the admissibility of the
anapaest into the third orfifth place of the Greek Tragic trimeter, except
in the case of Proper Names with the anapaest contained in the same word.
