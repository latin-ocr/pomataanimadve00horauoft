municatcd its name to the consular way that followed the coast from
Canusium to Brundisium. The ruins of this place arc still apparent
near the Torre d ’ A ynazzo and the town of Monopoli. Horace gives the
name which the town borc in the common language of the day, and this
also occurs in the Tab. Peutz'ny. The more correct form, however, is
Egnatia.—Lymphis iratis eoestructa. “Built auiid the anger of the
waters.” The meaning of the poet here is somewhat uncertain, as is
evidcnt from the scholiast giving us our choicc of three different explana-
tions. Thus he remarks: ¹⁴ Vel quia eyet aquis, vel qaod eas salsas
habet et amaras, vel quod in pede montis sita est,· ei idcirco videntur
aquae irasci, cum torrentes de montibus impetu magno decurrentes
saepe maynas urbis partes diruant.'' The first of these, the scarcity of
good water, appears to us the simplest, and it is adopted as the true one by
Manncrt. Perhaps, however, the poet has purposely used this expression,
in order that it may be susceptible of a double meaning, and that one of
these may refer to the silly superstition, or rather moon-struck madness
of the inhabitants, to which he refers immediately after.

99—104. 99. Dumflamma sine thura liquescere, &c. Pliny informs
us, that a certain stone was shown at Egnatia, which was said to possess
the property of getting fire to wood that was placed upon it. (Hist. Nat. ii.
107.) lt was this prodigy, no doubt, which affordcd so muc'n amuse-
ment to Horace; and from the expression limine sacro, thc stone in
question would appear to have been placed in the entrance of a temple
serving sor an anan—100. Judaeus Apella. “The Jew Apella.'’
Scaliger is undoubtedly right in considering Apella a mere proper name
of some well-known and superstitious Jew of the day.-101. Namque
deos didici, διο. “ For Ι have learned, that the gods pass their time free
from all concern about the affairs of men.'' Horace here acknowledgcs
his belief in one of the most remarkable doctrines of the Epicurean
school.—-IO3. Tristes. “Disquieting themselves about us.’'-104.
Brundisium. The most ancient and celebrated town on the coast of
Apulia, now Brindisi.
