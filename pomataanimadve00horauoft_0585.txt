their strong sense, their vigorous expression, or their lively and accurate
representations of life and manners, The old Auruncan receives no
fiveur, though he was the founder of that art in which Horace himself
chiefly excelled, and had left it to his successors only to polish and
resine. While decrying the course jests of 1”1ιιιιιιι5, Ine h ι5ι paid no
tribute to the comio force of his Musc3 nor, in the geneml odium
thrown on his illustrious predesce sors nas he consecrated a single linc
of panegyric to the natixe strength of Ennius, the simple majesty ot
Lucretius, or even the pure stJ le nnd unsullied ιιι5ιο of Terence.

His epistle, however, is ιι master-picce of delicate flattery and critical
art. The poet introduces his subject by confessing‚ that the Roman
people had, with equ il justice and uisdofn, heaped divine honours on
Augustus, while Jet present among the1n; but that, in matters of toste,
they were by no means so equiti mle since theJ treated the living bard,
however high his merit with contempt, and res 5οινοιί their homage for
those whom they dignifitd nith the name of ancients. He confutes
one argument by which this piepos 505 sion was 5ι ipported‚ —That the
oldest Greek writers, being incontestale superior to those of medem
date, it followed that the like preference should be given to the anti-
quated Roman masters.

Having obviated the popular and reigning prejudice against modern
poets, he proceeds ιο conciliate the imperial favour in their behalf, by
placing their pretensions in ιι just light. This leads him to give a
sketch of the progress of Latin poetrJ'‚ from its rude commencement in
the service of a. barbarous superstition, till his own time ; and to point
out the various causes which had im peded the attainment of perfectiori,
particularly in the theatrical department ;-ιι5 the little attention paid
to critical learning, the love of lucre which had infected Roman genius,
and the preference given to illiberal sports and shows over ali the
genuine beauties of the drama. He ιιι length appropriately concludes ,
his interesting subject- by applauding Augustus for the judicious patron-
age which he had already afforded to meritorious poets, and showing
the importance of still further extending his protection to those who
have the power of bestowing immortalitJ· on princes. lt is difficult to
say what influence this epistle may have had on the taste of *the age.
That it contributed to conciliate ι1ιο fax our of the public for the writers
of the day seems highlJ prob tble but it does not appear to have
eradicated the predilection for the oldest class of poets, which contin-
ued to be felt ιιι full force as late as the rei gn of Nero. (Compare Per-

sius, i. 76.)
