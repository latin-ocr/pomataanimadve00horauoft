unsa-onmem Lm. 1. 1. 455

Per mare pauperiem fugiens, per saxa, per ignes:
Ne cures ea, quae stulte miraris et optas,
Discere-et audire et meliori credere non vis ?
Quis circum pagos et circumeompita pugnax
Magna coronari contemnat Olympia, cui spes, 50
Cui sit conditio dulcis sine pulvere palmae?
Vilius argentum est auro, virtutibus aurum.
Ο cives, cives, qzuzerenda pecunia primum est,

Egypt, as Sanadon remarks, the passage to India was unknown to the
Romans. Strabo tells us, that while [Elius Gallus governed Egypt,
A. U. C. 727, a fleet of twenty-six merchantmen set sail from Myoshor-
mus, on the Sinus Arabicus, sor ludia. It was then that the Roman
navigation between Egypt and India began to be regulated. As regards
the term mercator, consult note οη Ode 1. i. 16.—46. Per igne-5⁸,- a
proverbial form of expression, equivalent in effect to per summa quoeque
pericula.—47. Ne cures ea, qnae stalle miraris, ἃς. “ Art thou unwill-
ing to learn, and to hear, and to trust thyself to the guidance of some
wiser friend, that thou mayest no longer care for those things which thou
foolishly admirest and wishest sor 1-2’ Discere here applies to instruction
obtained by perusing the works of philosophers, and audire to that which
is received by listening to their 01-‹11 teaching.

49—51. 49. Quis puynalz‘. “ What petty champion.'' The idea
intended to be couveyed is as follows: Who would not rather be crowned
at the Olympio games, especially if he could obtain the palm there with-
out the necessity of exer-tion, than roam about, a village champion, and
spend his days in ignoble conflicts? or, in more general language : Who
is there that would prefer things of a low and humble nature, such as
riches and the world·s honours, to the pursuit of true wisdom, which no
danger accompanies, and which carries with it no cares or anxieties to
embitter our existence ?—50. Mayna coronari contemnat Olympia.
“ Will scorn being crowned at the great Olympio games.” Mayna
coronari Olympia is in imitation of the Greek idiom, στεφανοῦσθαι
Ὀλύμπια, in place of the regular Latin form, coronari in magmis Olym-
piis—51. Cui sic conditio dulcis sine pulvere palmae. “ Who shall

⁷ have the condition proposed to him, of gaining without toil the glorious

palm.'' As regards the rewards bestowed at the Olympio and other
gamm, as well as respecting the nature of these games themselves con-
sult note on Ode 1. i. 3. and 1. i. 5.—Sine pult-cre. As to the possibility
of a victor's obtaining the prize at the Olympio, or any other gamoe,
without toil or exertion, it may be remarked, that this could easily hap-
pen, if no antagonist came forward to meet the champion.

52—60. 52. Vilius arpentum es! (ιω-ο, ἃς. The poet now envers
on a general train of reasonffig, in order to show the superiority of vir-
tue over all that the world prizes, and makes the object of its pursuit.
If what is more valuable, argues he, is to be preferred to what is less so,
then is virt-ue to be preferred to gold, as gold is to silver. The maxims
of the day, it is true, teach that money is first to be acquired‚ and virtue
after money; but be it thine to obtain that before all other things, which
brings with it a conscience unstained by guilt, aud a countenance that
