Ettr‘oms atque Cratinus Aristophanesque, poetae,

Quod moechus foret, aut sicarius, aut alioqui

he had received from his father, who, when bc wished to deter him from
any vice, showed its bad consequenccs iu the example of others.

1—2. l. Eupolis. An Athenian poet of the Old comedy. He was
bom about B. C. 446, and was nearly of the sanie agc with Aristophanes.
--Cratinus- Another Athenian poet of thc Old comedy, born B. C.
oxa-Aristophanes. Of Aristophanes antiquity supplies us with few
notices, and those of doubtful credit. The most likely account makes him
the son of Philippus a native of Aegina. (Acharn. 651, 2. Schol. Vit.
Aristoph. Anonym. Alhenaeas, vi. 227.) The comediam therefore,
was au adopted, not a natural, citizen of Athens. The exact dates of his
birth and death are equally unknown.—2. Atque alii, quorum, διε.
“ And others, whose Cotncdy is of the old school : '⁸ i. e. and other writers
of the Old comedy. Ancicnt comcdy was divide-d into the Old, tho stlid-
da'e, and the New. In the first, thc subject and the characters were real.
In tho second, the subject was still real, but the characters were invented.
In the third, both the story and thc characters were formed by the poet.
The Middlc comcdy arose towards the end of the Peloponnesian war,
when a few poisons had possessed themselves of [hc soret-cignty of Athens,
contrary to the constitution, and chcekcd the linense and freedom of the
Old comcdy, by having a dccree passed, that whocver was attacked‘by the
comic poets might prosecute them: it was forbidden also to bring real
persons on the stage, to imitate their features with masks‚ &a The eomic
drama, after more than half a century ‹ f vacillating transitiou from its old
to its subsequent form, in the age of llcxandcr finali) settled down,
through the ill- defined gradatione of the Middle, into the Now comedy.
The Old comcdy drew its subjects stom public, the Ncw from priv ate life.
The Old comedy often took its “ dramatis personae ”from the generals, thu
cratem, the demagogucs, or the philosophers ‚of the day; in the Now, the
characters were always fictitious. The Old comedy was made up of per-
sonal satire and the broadcst niirth, exhibitcd under all the forms, and
withan the accompaniments, which uncontrollcd fancy and frolic could
conceive. The New comedy was osa more temperate and regulated nature:
its satiro was aimcd at the abstract vicc or desect, not at the individual
offender. Its mirth was of a restrained kind; and, as being a faithful
picture of life, its descriptions of men and manners were accurate portraits,
not wild caricaturcs3 and, for the sanie reason, its gaiety was often inter-
rupted by seenes of a grave and affecting character. The principal writers
of the Middlo comedy were Eubulus, Araros,1xntiphanes, Anaxandridcs,
Alexis, and Ep ieratcs· ‚ of the New, Philippides, Timoelee, Philemon,
Menander, Diphilus, Apollodorus, and posidippus. (Theatra of the
Greeks, 2’d. edp.185. seqq.)
