33³3 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Durus homo, atque odio qui posset vincere Regem,
confidens, tumidusque, adeo sermonis amari,

Sisennae, Barros ut equis praecurreret albis.

Ad Regem redeo. Postquam nihil inter utrumque
Convenit : (hoc etenim sunt omnes jure molesti, 10
Quo fortes, quibus adversum bellum incidit : inter
Hectora Priamiden, animosum atque inter Achillem

Ira fuit capitalis, ut ultima divideret mors,

N on aliam ob causam nisi quod virtus in utroque

the Sinus Smyrnaeus, and, on account of its advantageous situation for
(wunnierce, received many favours from Alexander the Great, and subsc-
q‘ccntl‘y from the Romans.

6—8. 6. Durus homo, διο. “ Α fellow of harsh and stubborn tem·
per, and who in insolent importunity could surpass even the King.”
As regards the peculiar meaning of odium in this passage, compare
Ruhnken, ad Terent. Plzorm. v. vi. 93 Ernesti, θίαν. Cio. s. v.—7.
Adeo sermonis amari, &a “ Of so bitter a tongue, usfar to ontstrip the
Sisennae, the Barri.'' The terms Sisennas and Barros are here taken
as appellatives‚ and the reference is to persons in general, as infamous
for the virulence of their desamatory milings as Sisenna and Barrus.
With regal-d to the latter of these two individuals, consult note on Serm.
1. iv. 110. Dat-ier thinks that the other is the same with Cornelius
Sisenna, of whom Dio Cassius (liv. 27) relates a very discreditable
anecdote.-—8. Equis praecurreret albis. A proverbial form of expres-
sion, and equivalent to longe superaret. Various explanations are as-
signed for this peculiar mode of speech, the most common of which is,
that white horses were thought by the ancients to be the swiftest. Coni-
pare Erasmus: (ΟΜΖ. l. cent. 4. 21. p. 138. ed. steph.) “ Ubi quem
aliis quapiam in re longe superiorem siynificabmzt, longoque anteire
intervallo, eum albis equis praecedere tlicebant; vel, quod antiquitus
equi albi meliores huberentur; vel, quod victores in triumpho albis
equis vectari soleant3 vel, quod albi equi fo‘rtunatiores et auspica-
tiores esse credantur, ut ad equestrecerlamen referamus metaphoram.”

9—17. 9. Postquam nihil inter utrumque convenit. “ When no
reconciliation could be effeeted between tbem.'’ Or, more literally,
“after nothing was agreed upon between the two.'’—10. Hoc etenim
sunt omnes, διο. “ For all, between whom adverse war breaks out, are,
by this fixed law of our nature, troublesome to one another in propor-
tion as they are valiant.''—12. Hectora Priamiden, &c. The compari-
sonhere drawn is extremely amusing, and is intended to give an air of
scriousncss and importance to this mighty combat. It is death alone,
observes the poet, that can terminate the differences between brave men
such as Hector and Achilles, Persius and Rupilius. Whereas, if two
faint-hearted men engage‚ or two persons not equally matched in cou-
rage and in strength, one of them is always sure to give up.—l3. Ira
fuit capitalis, &c. The order of construction is, suit tam capitalis ira
ut ultima mors solum divideret illos. “ There was so deadly a send,
that the utter destruction ot' ene of the two could alone terminate their
