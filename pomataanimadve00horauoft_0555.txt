EPISTOLA-Rmi ΕΓΒ. 1. 16. 513

Aiebat, si qui comedunt bona, quum sit obeso φο
Nil melius turdo, nil vulva pulchrius ampla.

Nimirum hic ego sum: nam tuta ct parvula laudo,

Quum res deficiunt, satis inter vilia fortis;

Verum, ubi quid melius contingit et unctius, idem

Vos sapere et solos aio bene vivere, quorum 45
Conspicitur nitidis 'fundata pecunia villis.

EPISTOLA XVI.
AD QUINCTIUM.

Nn perconteris, fundus meus, optime Quincti,
Arvo pascat herum, an baccis opulentet olivae,
Pomisne, an pratis, an amicta vitibus ulmo:

sumum et cinerem. A figurative mode of expression, to denote the
entire wasting and consuming of a thing—40. Si qui comedunt bona.
“ If some persons eat up their estates.''-—-4l. Nil vulva pulchrius ampla.
‘⁶ Nothing fairer than a large sow's paunch.'’ This was esteemed a
great dainty among the Romans-42. Nimirum hic eyo sum, &cz
“ Just such a one am I ; for, when I have nothing better, Ι commend
my quiet and frugal repast 3 resolute enough amid humble fare.’' The
poet now refers to himself. Quum res deficiunt may be more literally
rendered, “ when better means fail? Hic is by an elegant usage equi-
valent to talis—44. Verum, ubi quid melius continyit et unctius.
“ When, however, any thing better and more delicate offers‚” οι· more
literaliy, “falls to my lot.’'-45. Quorum conspicitur nitidis, otc.
“ Whose money is seen well and safely laid out in villas conspicuous for
their elegance and beauty.'' Fundam is here equivalent to bene ct
tuto collocata3 and nitidis, to pulchritudine et nitore conspicuis.

Emsms XVI.—Quinctius Hirpinus is thought to have written to
Horace, reproaching him with his long stay in the country, and desiring
a description of that little retirement where the poet professed to find so
much happiness, and which he was so willing to exchange for the
society of the capital. Horace yields to his request, and, after a short
account of his retreat, and the manner in which he enjoyed himself
there, falls into a digression concerning virtum where, aster rejecting
several false accounts and definitions, he endeavours to teaeh its true-
nature and properties. As this discussion is of a. serious character, the
poet seeks to enliven it by adopting the dialogue form.

1—8. 1. Quincti. The individual here addressed is generally
supposed to be the same with the one to whom the eleventh ode of the
second book is inscribed. Bothe, however, maintains that the person
meant is Τ. Quinctius Crispinus, who was consul A. U. C. 745, and
one of those driven into exile in the affair of Julia, the daughter
of Augustus.—·2. Ανυο. “By its harvest ;'' or, more literally, “by
tinage.’'—3. An amicta vitibus ulmo. “ Or with what the vine-clad elm

bestows,” i. e. with wine. An elegagt allusion to the Roman practice
