CARMINUM 12111. 11. 19. 123

Tu flectis amnes, turnare barbarum:
Tu separatis uvidus in jugis
N odo coerces viperino
Bistonidum sine fraude crines. 20

Tu, quum parentis regna per arduum
Cohors Gigantum scanderet impia,
Rhoetum retorsisti leonis
Unguibus horribilique mala :

Quamquam, choreis aptior et jocis 25
Ludoque dictus, non sat idoneus
Pugnae ferebaris 3 sed idem
Pacis eras mediusque belli.

Te vidit insons Cerberus aureo
Cornu decorum, leniter atterens 30
Caudam, et recedentis trilingui
Ore pedes tetigitque crura.

Pentheus, king of Thebes, who was torn in pieces by his own mother, and
her sistere, and his palace overthrown by Bacchus.—-16. Lycurgi. Lycur-
gus, king of the Edonos in Thrace, punished for having driven the infant
Bacchus from his kingdom.—l7. Tuflectis amnes, &c. “ Thou turnest
bankward the courses of rivers, thou swayest the billows of the Indiau eea·,”
alluding to the wondcrs performed by Bacchus, in his fablcd conquestos
India and other regions of the East. The rivers here meant are the Orontes

· and Hydaspes.-—l8. Tu separatis, «Sec. “ On the loncly mountain tops,

moist with wine, thou confinest, without harm to them, the locks of the
Bacchantes with a knot of vipers ; ” i. e. under thy influence, the Bacchan-
tes tie up their locks, &c.—20. Bietonz'dum ; litemlly, “ of the female
Bistones.’' Here, however, equivalent to Baccharum.

23—31. 23. Leonis urz-quibus. Bacchus was fabled to have assumed
on this occasion the form of a lion.———-25. Quamquam choreis, διο.
“ Though said to be fitver for dances and festive mirth.’'— 26. Non sat
idoneus. ¹¹ Not equally well-suited.'’—27. Sed idem, &c. “ Yet, on
that occasion. thou, the same deity, didst become the arbiter of peace and
of war.'' The poet means to convey the idea, that the interventiou of
Bacchus alone put an end to the muniet. Had not Bacchus lent his aid,
the battle must have been longer in its duration, and different perhaps in
its issue.—29. Ι nsons. ⁴² Without offcring to hai-m.” Bacchus descended
to the shades for the purpose of bringing back his mother Semele-Aureo
cornu decorum. Α figurative illuso-anon of the power of tbe god. The
horn was the well-known emblem of power among the :mestum—31. Ee

guardian of the shadcs, who allows egrcss to none that have once entered
the world of spirits.
