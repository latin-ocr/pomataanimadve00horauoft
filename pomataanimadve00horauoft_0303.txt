Eponox mnan. 16. 263

Nec fera. caerulea domuit Germania pube,
Parentibusquc abominatus Hannibal :

Impia perdemus devoti sanguinis aetas ;
Ferisque rursus occupabitur solum. 10

Barbarus, heu! cineres insistet victor, et Urbem
Eques sonante verberabit ungula3

Quaeque carent ventis ct solibus, ossa Quirini,
Nefas videre ! dissipabit insolens.
Forte, quid expediat, communiter, aut melior pars 15
Malis carere quaeritis laboribus.
Nulla sit hac potior seutentia; Phocaeorum
Velut profugit exsecrata civitas :
Agros atque Lares proprios, habitandaque fana
Apris reliquit ot rapacibus lupis : 20

6. Novisque rebus infidelis Allobrooe. “ And the Allobroges, faithlcss

crimes—ll. Barbarus,· alluding to the barbarian nations which formed
partos the forces of Antony.—Ec Urbem eques, &c. ⁴‘ And the horse-
men strike our city with sounding hoof,’' i. e. ride insultingly over the
ruins of fallen Rome.—l3. Quaeque carent ventis, διε. “ And inso-
lently scatter the bones of Romulus, which lie concealed from winds and
suns (unlawful to be beheld !)’' The sanctity of sepulchres was always
guarded by tbe strictest laws, aud their sacred character was founded
on the circumstance of their being dedicated to the Manes. The tombs
of the founders of cities were regarded as particularly entitled to vene-
ration, and it was deemed a most inauspicious omen, if the remains
contained in them were, by accident, or in any other way, exposed to

mon, or else the better portion, arc inquim‘ng of yourselves, what is best to
be done, in order to avcrt these dreadful calamities.’' By· the expression
melior pars are meant those who hold civil conflicta in abhorrence, and
who feel for the miseries of their country.-—l7. Phocaeorum velut pro-
suyit, διο. “ As the people of Phocaea ssed, bound by solemn impreca-
tions; as they abandoned,'' &ru The Phocaeans, a people of Ionia,
