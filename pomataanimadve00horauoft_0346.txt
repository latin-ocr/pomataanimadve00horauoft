306 > Q. HORATII FLACCI

Abjecto instrumento artis clausaque taberna,

Tonsor erat : sapiens operis sic optimus omnis

Est opg'fhoe solus, sic ream—vellunt tibi barbam

Lascivi pueri, quos tu nisi fuste coerces,

Urgueris turba circum te stante, miserque 135
Rumperis, et latras, magnorum maxime regum.

Ne longum faciam, dum tu quadrante lavatum

Rex ibis, neque te quisquam stipator, ineptum

Praeter Crispinum, sectabitur: et mihi dulces

Ignoseent, si quid peccaro stultus, amici; 140
Inque vicem illorum patiar delicta libenter,

Privatusque magis vivam te rege beatus.

to some of the highest offiees in the empire, and obtained the consulship,
A. U. C. 755.—132. Operis optimus omnis opifex. ‘⁶ The best artist
in every kind of workff'

133—140. 133. Vellzmt tihi barbam. The poet replies, and draws
a laughable picture of the philosophie monarch, surrounded by the young
rabble in the streets of Rome. To pluck a man by the beard was regarded
as such an indignity, that it gave rise to a proverb among both the
Greeks and Romans. To this species of insult, however, the wandering
philosophers of the day were frequently exposed fron] the boys in the
streets of Rome, the attention of the young tormento-:s being attracted by
the very long beai-ds which these pretenders to wisdom were fond of dis-
playing.-—]3(3. Rumpor-is, el latras. “Thou burstest with fage and
snarlest at them.” NVieland thinks that latras is here purposely used,
in allusion to the resemblance which in some respects existed between
the Stoics and Cynics of the day.—137. Ne lon-qum faciam. Supply
sermonem. ‘¹ Not to be tedious.''—Qaadrante lavatum. “To bathe
for a farthing;” i. e. to the farthing bath. As the publio baths at
Rome were built mostly for the common people, they afforded but
very indifferent accommodatione. People of fashion had always private
baths os their own. The strolling philosophers of the day frequented,
of course, these public baths, and mingled with the lowest of the people.
The pn'ce of admission was a quadrans, or the fourth part of an as.
-—l38‚ Stipator. ‘⁶ Life-guardsman.'' A laughable allusion to the re·
tinue of the Stoic monarch. His royal body-guard consists of the ridicu-
lous Crispinus. Compare, as respects this individual, the note on Satire
1. i. 120.-140. Stultus. Another thrust at the Stoics. Compare note
on verse 77. ’

SATmE IV.—It would appear, that during the lifetime of Horace the
public were divided in their judgment conceming his Satires—some
blaming them as too severe, while others thought them weak an'd
trifling. Our author, in order to vindicate himself from the charge of
indulging in too much asperiori, shows, in a manner the most prepossess-
ing, that he had been less harsh than many other poets3and pleads, ao
his excuse for at all practising this species of composition, the education
