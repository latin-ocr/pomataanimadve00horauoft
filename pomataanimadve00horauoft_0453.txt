Nam quamvis memori referas mihi pectore cuncta, ενι
Non tamen interpres tantundem juveris. Adde

Vultum habitumque hominis; quein tu vidisse beatus

Non magni pendis, quia contigit; et inihi cura

Non mediocris inest, fontes ut adire remotos,

Atque haurire queam vitae praecepta beatae. 03

88-92. 88. Docte Cati, &a The conclusion is in a happy strain
of irony. The poet expresses liis gratitnde in the liveliest ternis, and
begs to be introduced to an audience with the distinguished author οἷ’
these precepts‚ that he may hear them from his own lips, and drink in
at the fountain-head the rules and maxims of a happy life—89. Ducere
me anditum. “To take meto hear the man liimself.”—Peryes quc-
cunque. “ Whithersoever thou shalt go to find him ;'' i. e. wherever
he may dwell. This refers back to verse ll, where Catius declares that
he will not mention the name of the individual.—9l. Interpres. ⁶⁶ As a

manner of the man.” Habitum has an ironica} reference to the grave
and dignified deportment of this sage instructor.—93. Quia contigit.
‘⁶ Because such has been thy lot.”

SATIRE V.—- To this Satire also, like the last, a dramatic form is
given. In a dismurse, supposed to be held between Ulysses and Tire-
sias, Horace satirizes the sordid attempts frequently made by Roman
citizens, to enrich themselves by paying assiduous court to old and
wealthy bachelors and widowers. There is considerable pleasantry in
the satire itself‚ but its subject is introduced in a forced and improbable
manner. Homer, in the eleventli book of the Odyssey, had represented
Ulysses as consulting Tiresias on the means of being restored to his
native country3 and Horace, eommencing his dialogue at the point
where it was lest off by the Greek poet, introduces Ulysses‚ ruined in
fortune, and destitute of all things, seeking advice of Tiresias as to the
mode of repairing his shattered affaixs. The answer of the prophet forms
the subject of the satire, and is so directly levelled at the manners of the
Romans, that we cannot forget the incongruity of these being described
in a dialogue between a Greeian chief and a Grecian soothsayer‚ both of
whom existed, if we follow the common account, before the foundation of
Rome. The whole, however, may 2perhaps be regarded as a sort of
