SERMONFM Lm. Π. 3. 385

Integer est mentis Damasippi creditor? esto. 65
Accipe quod nunquam reddas mihi, si tibi dicam,

Tune insanus eris, si acceperis, an magis exem-S,

Rejecta praeda, quam praesens Mercurius fert 2

Scribe decem a Nerio : non est satis : adde Cicutae

N odosi tabulas centum ; mille adde catenas : 70
Effugiet tamen haec sceleratus vincula Proteus.

Quum rapies in jus malis ridentem alienis,

Fiet aper, modo avis, modo saxum, et, quum volet, arbor.

Si male rem gerere insani, contra bene sani cst,

Dictantis, quod tu nunquam rescribere possis.
Audire atque togam jubeo componere, quisquis

65. Esto. Accipe qnod nunquam, ἃς. An indirect mode is adopted to
prove the insanity of Damasippus‘s creditor. 'she poet, for argument‘s
sake, concedes at first that he is sane, (Esto, ‘⁶ suppose for a moment
that hc is so,”) only to prove him eventually altogether out of his senses.
If Ι tell thee, observes Stertinius, to take what I know thou wilt never be
able to repay, will it be madness in thee to accept of it Ρ Will it not
rather be the height of madncss for thee to refuse such an offer Ρ It is
1, then, that am mad in acting this part to thee—68. Praesens Merca-
νίας. “ Propitious Mercury.”—69. Scribe decem a Nerio .· non est
satis, ἃς. With scribe supply tabulas. Stertinius is now supposed to
address some sordid usurer, whom he advises to take care and not be
over-reached in lending out his money. “ Write ten obligations for the
repayment of the money, after the form ‹lew'sed by Nerius} 'tis not
enough ε Add the hundred covenants of the knotty Cicuta ;” i. e. make
the individual who borrows of thee sign his name, not to one merely, but
to ten obligations sor repayment, and let these be drawn up aster the form
which Nerius, crastiest of bankers, has devised, and which he compels his
own debtors to sign ε Still this form, cautious and guanled ns it is, will
not prove strong enough: Add to it tho hundred eovenants of the banker
Cicuta, with which, as if they were so many knots, hc ties down his
debtors to their agreements.——72. Alalis ridentem alienis. “ Laughing
with the cheeks of another.” Commentators differ in their explanation
of this phrase. According to some it means ‘⁴ laughing immoderately;”
others take it to denote “ laughing at the expense of another ;'' while a
third class render it, “ forcing a laugh.”

75—88. 75. Putidius multo cerebrum est,&c. “ Believe me, the hrain
of Pen’ssius‘ is by far the more addle of the two, who lends thee money
which thou canst never repay;” i. e. lends it at such an exorbitant rate.
of interest as to preclude the possibility of its being ever repaid. Perillim:
appears to have been a noted muron—76. Dictantis. This term herc
refers literally to the creditor's dictating the form of the written obliga-
tion for repayment. This the borrower writes and signs. If the money
is repaid‚ another writing is signed by both the borrower and lender.
Hence scribere, “ to borrow ;” and rescribere, “ to repay.'’—-77. Audire
