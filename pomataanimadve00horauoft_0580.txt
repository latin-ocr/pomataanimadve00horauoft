importance to t1-ifles.”—43. Rides ait. “Thou art laughing at us,
says one of these same g1·ammaria11s.”—Jovis; referring to Augustus.
-44. Illarum-e. This verb is here construed with the accusative, in the
sense of emittere or enudare—45. Tibi pulcher. “ Wondrous fair in
thine own eyes ;'' i. e. extremely well pleased with thyselfi—Ad haec
eyo naribus uti formido. “ At these words I am afraid to turn up my
nose.'’ Our poet, observes Dacier, was afraid of answering this in-
sipid raillery with the contempt it deserved, for fear of being beaten.
He had not naturally too much courage, and bad poets are a choleric,
testy generation.-47. Ee diludia posco. “ And I ask for an intermis-
sion.” The Latius used diludia to denote an intermission of fighting
given to the gladiators during the publ³e gameS. Horace therefore
pleasantly begs he may have time allowed him to correct his verses,

this, the first book of his episties, was anxious to go forth into public,
though against his will, proceeds to foretell, like another prophet, the
fate that would inevitably accompany this rash design. It is evident,
however, from what follows after the 17th verse, that all these gloomy
forebodings had no real existence whatever in the poet’s imagination;
but that his eye rested on clear and distinct visions of future fame. ’

1-5. 1. Vertumnum Janumque, &e Near the temples of Ver-
tumnus and Janus were p01·tieoeS‚ around the columns of which the
booksellers were accustomed to display their books for sale. Consult
note on Sat. 1. iv. 71.—·2. Scilicet. 110nica1.-Sosioram pumice mun-
dus. ‘⁶ Smoothed by the pumice of the Sosii.’' A part of the process
of preparing works sor sale consisted in smoothing the parchment with
pumice-stone, in order to remove all excrescences from the surfaoe.
