248 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Nam, qualis aut Molossus, aut fulvus Lacon, 5
Amica vis pastoribus,

Agam per altas aure sublata nives,
Quaecunque praecedet fera.

Tu, quum timenda voce complesti nemus⁷
Projectum odoraris cibum. 10

Cave, cave: namque in malos asperrimus
Parata tollo cornua 3

Qualis Lycambae spretus infido gener,
Aut acer hostis Bupalo.

An, si quis atro dente me petiverit, 15
Inultus ut flebo puer?

aut fulvus Lacon. ‘'‘ A Molossian, or a tawny Laconiau dog.’ The
Molossi-au and Laconian dogs were of a robust make, and valuable as well
in hunting wild beasts as iu defending the flocks from nocturnal thieves,
and from the attacks of wolves. The Molossi occupied the north-eastern
part of Epirus.—6. Amica vis. “A friendly aid.''-7. Ayam quae-
eunque praecedet sera. “ Ι will pursue whatever savage bcast shall go
before me.'' Put for aqam quameunque quae mihi praecedet feram.
—10. Projectum odoraris cibum. ‘⁴ Smell at the food thrown to
thee.⁷’ A figurative mode of expressing that the individua! whom hc
attacks was easily bribed to silence—12. Parata tollo cornua. The
poet alludes to his Iambics, with which he stands prepared to assail all
evil-doers, as the bull is ready with its horns against every one who pro-
vokes it to the attach—13. Qualis Lycambae, &c. ‘⁸ Like him who
was rejected as a son-in-law by the faithless Lycambeo⁷ or like the fierce
enemy of Bupalus.'’ Lycambae is the dative, by a Graecism, for the
ablative, and by another Graecism, Bupalo, the dative, is put for Rapaci.
—Lycambaa The allusion is to Archilochus. Lycambes had promised
him his daughter Neobule in marriage, but afterwards changed his mind
and gave her to another. Archilochus, in revenge, wrote a poem against
him in Iambic verse, so cruelly satirical that both father and daughter hung
themselves in despair. Such, at least, is the common account. It would
seem, however, from some authorities, that Neobule killed herself, not on
account of the verses of Archilochus, but through despair at the loss of her
father. Compare SchoelL Hist. Lit. Graec. vol. i. p. 199.—14.-
Bupalo* The allusion is to the poet Hipponax, aud the brothers Bupalus
and Anthermus.
