his amorous propensities, with the contamination of his times clinging
about them, we may, out of respect to his good qualities, be silent:
for let it never be forgotten, that Horace forms an honourable excep-
tion to the class of voluptuaries, and that he has left us much that is
praiseworthy and valuable to redeem his errors.

‘⁴ Horace, of all the writers of antiquity, most abounds with that
practical good sense, and familiar observation of life and manners,
which render an author, in a more emphatic sense, the reader's com-
panion. Good sense, in fact, seems the most distinguishing feature of
his Satires ; for his wit seems to me rather forced ; and it is their tone
of sound understanding, added to their easy conversational air, and a
certain turn for fine raillery‚ that forms the secret by which they please.
His metre is even studiously careless: he expressly disclaims the
fabrication of polished verse, and speaks of his ‘⁴ Pedestrian Muse.⁷'
Swift is a far better copyist of his manner than Pope, who should have
imitated Juvenal. But the lyric poetry of Horace displays an entire
command of all the graces and powers of metre. Elegance and just-
ness of thought, and felicity of expression, rather than sublimity, seem
to be its general character, though the poet sometimes rises to consi-
derable grandeur of sentiment aud imagery. In variety and versatility
his lyric genius is unrivalled by that of any poet with whom we are
acquainted; and there are no marks of inequality‚ or of inferiority to
himself. VVhether his Odes be of the moral and philosophical kind ;
the heroic, the descriptive‚ or the amatory ; the light and the joyous ;
each separate species would seem to be his peculiar province. His
Epistles evince a knowledge of the weakness of the human heart,
which would do honour to a professed phiIOsopher. What Quintilian,
and the moderns after him, call the ‘Art of Poetry,' seems to have
been only the third epistle of the second book, addressed to the Pisos.
The style and manner differ in no respect from the former epistles ι
The observations are equally desultory, and we meet with the-same
strokes of satirical humour; which appear unsuitable to a didactic
piece. Dr. Hurd‚ indeed, has discovered the utmost order and con-
nexion in this epistle, which he supposes to contain a complete system
of rules for dramatic composition. But Hurd was a pupil of War-
burton; and, together with much of his ingenuity, had imbibecl also
much of the paradox of his master. His commentary, however, is
extremely interesting*.’'
