splendid residencc of Maecenas was erected there—33. Aliena neyotia
centum, ἃς. ·” Α hundred affairs of other people leap through my head,
and around my side ;” i. e. besct me on every side. Compare the form
which the same idea would assume in our vulgar idioma “ Ι am over
head and ears in the affairs of 0t110rs.”—34. Ante secundam. ‘⁶ Before
eight ;” literally, ‘⁴ before the second hour.” We must suppose, that.
when Horace reaches the abodc of his patron on the Esquiline, a slave
meets him, and mentions who had been there for him, and what they
wished—35. Ad Puteal. ‘⁶ At the Puteal.” The term puteal pro-
perly means ‘⁶ the cover of a well or pit.” It is then taken to denote
any cavity or hole in the earth, summunted by a cover ; and, last of all,
signifies a place surrounded by a wall, in the form of a square, and
roofed over ; resembling somewhat a kind of altar. These little struc-
tures were commonly erected on spots which had been struck by light-
ning, though not always. ⁴

36—44. 36. De re commum· scribae, ἃς. “ The notaries, Quintus,
requested that thou wouldst bear in mind to return to them ‘tp-day, in
order to consult about an important and novel matter, which concerns
their whole number.” The scribae were notaries or clerks, who wrote
out the public accounts, the laws, and all the proceedings of the magis-
trates—38. Imprimat his, cura, sslaecenas, &c- “ Be so good as to get
Maecenas to seal these tables;” i. e. to put the imperial seal to these
writings. Maecenas would seal them in the name of the emperor, from
whom he had received the imperial signet ; a duty which appertained
to him as Praefectus U rbis and the minister of Augustus. The address
in the text comes, not like the two previous ones, through the medium
of the slave, but from the applicant lrimselttZ—39. Dioeeris, for si dixeris,
and that for εἰ di„ve=›·in2.—Si vis, potes. “ Thou canst if thou wilt.”
—4o. Septimus octavo propior, ecc. ‘⁶ The seventh year, approaching
to the eighth‚ is now, if 1 mistake not, elapsed ;'' i. e. ’tis now, if Ι
mistake not, nearly eight years. The elegant use of the mood in faye-
rit, which we have endeavoured to preserve in our version, must be care-
fully notak—42. Duntaoeat ad lzoc, ἃς. “ Only thus far, however ; as
one whom he might wish to take along with him in his char-iot, when
going on a journey.”-—-44. Hocyenus. “ Of this kind‚” i. e. such as
these that follow—Thra cst Gallina Syro par? ‘⁶ Is Gallina, the
