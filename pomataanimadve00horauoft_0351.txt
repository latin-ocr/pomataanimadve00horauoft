proper number of feet—42. Sermoni. “ To prosc ;” ἱ. e. the everyday
language of common intercourse. Horace here refers to the style of his
Satires, and their piu-posely-neglectcd air. His claims to the title of
poet rest on his lyric producti0ns3 but at the time when the present
Satire was written, he had made only a few efforts in that species of
versification in which he was afterwards to receive the highest honours
of poet1·y.—43. Inyenium cui sit, &c. The term inyenium here means
that invention, and the expression mens divinior that cnthusiasrn or
poetic inspiration‚ which can alone give success to the votaries of the
opic‚ tragic, or lyrie muse. By the os mayna sanaturum is meant noble-
ness of style, which also forms au important attribute iu the character of
a poet.

46—56. 46. Quod acer sparilus ac vis, «Sec. “ Because neither the
style nor the subjectamatter possessos lire and foree; because it is tnere
prose, except in so far as it differs from prose by having a certain fixed
measure.'’ The reasoning in the text is as follows: Three things are
requisite to form a great poet—richness of invention, firc of imaginafion,
and noblcuess of style. But since comt-dy has none ofthese, it is doubted
whether it be a real poem.—48. Ac pater ardens, ἃς. The poet hene
supposes some one to object to his remark respecting the want of fire
and force in comcdy, by referring to the spirited mode in which the
character of the angry father is drawn, when iailing at the excesses of a.
dissipated son. The allusion is to Demea iu Terencc’s ‘⁶ Adelphi,’' and to
Chremes in the ‘⁴ Self-tormentor '’ of the same poen—49. Neposfilius.
“ His dissolute son.’'——51. Ambulet ante noctem cum facibus. The
reference here is more to Greek thau Roman manners, the comcdies of
Terence being mere imitations of those of Menander. The intoxicated
and profligate youth were aecustomcd to rove about the streete, with
torches, at a late honr of the night, after having ended their orgies within
deors. But far more (lisgracetul was it to appear in the public streets in
a state of intoxicarion, and bearing torchcs, before the day was drawn to
a close—52. Numquid Pomponius istis, Sec. We have here the reply
of the poet, which is simply this: That, with whatever vehemcncc of
lauguagc the angry father rates his son, it is very little different from
what Pomponius might expect from his father, if he were alive. It is
the natural lauguage ot· the passinus expresscd in measures.—53. Levi-
ora. “ Less severe reproofs.”—Eryo. In order to understand the con-
