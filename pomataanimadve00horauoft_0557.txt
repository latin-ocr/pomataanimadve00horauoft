Jactamus jampridem omnis te Roma beatum.

Sed vereor, ne cui de te plus, quam tibi credus3

Neve putes alium sapiente bonoque beatum ; ενι)
Neu, si te populus sanum recteque valentem

Dictitet‚ occultam febrem sub tempus edendi

Dissimules, donec manibus tremor incidat unctis.
Stultorum incurata pudor malus ulcera celat.

Si quis bella tibi terra pugnata marique 25
Dicat, et his verbis vacuas permulceat aures :

T ene maglis salvam populus velit, αη populum tu,

would insinuate to Quinctius, that the tranquil and innocent pleasunes
he found there were infinitely preferable to the dangerous and tumul-
tuous puxsuits of ambition. He would inform him, that happiness,
founded upon the opinion of others, is weak and unceitain3 that the
praises which we receive from a mistaken applause are really paid to
virtue, not to us ; and that, while we are outwardly honoured, esteemed,
and applauded, we are inwardly contemptible and miserable. Such was
probably the then situation of Quinctius, who disguised, under a seeming
severity of manners, the most irregular indulgences of ambition and
sensuality. Some years asterwards he broke through all restraint, aad
his incontinence plunged him into the last distresses.

Sed vereor, ue cui de te plus, &c. “But Ι am under great apprehensions,
lest thou mayest give more credit concerning thyself to any other than
thyself, or lest thou mayest imagine that one may ,be happy who is
other than wise and good ;” i. e. Ι am afraid lest, in a thing that so
intimately concerns thee as thy own happiness, thou mayest trust more
to the testimony of others than to the suggestions of thine own mind,
and mayest fancy that happiness can subsist without wisdom and
virtue. As regards the construction of ,the sentence it may be remarked,
that the ablatgives sapiente and bono follow alium, because this last
impliae a comparison. -21, Neu, si te P( 0‚pulus &e The continuation
of ideas 13 33 follows. I am afraid also lest thou gh all pronounce thee

well and ln perfect health, thou ma) est in reality be the prey of disease, ’

and resemble him who conceals the lurking sever, at the hour for eating,
lest food be denied him, until his malady too plainly shows itself by the
trembling of his hands while busied with the contents of the dish. The

degree of intimacy that subsisted between Horace and Quinctius may ι

easily be inferred from the present passage, and the lines which unme-
diately precede it; for who but a xery intimate friend would hold such
language to another ?—-‘23. Manibus unctis. The Romans did not use
knives and forks in eating, but employed their singem—24. Pudor
malus. “ The false shame.”

valent here to canat. —Vacuas. “Open to his strains.' ⁹-27. Tene
magis salvum populus telit, otc. The careless manner of introducing
the praisoe and name of Augustus, is not the least beautiful part of this
passage. That his glories are inseparable from those of the state, and
