536 Q. nortun FLACCI

Non aliena meo pressi pede. Qui <ibi fidit,
Dux regit examen. Parios ego primus iambos
Ostendi Latio, numeros animosque secutus

Archilochi, non res et agentia verba Lycamben. 05
Ac, ne me foliis ideo brevioribus ornes,

Quod timui mptare modos et carminis artem ε

Temperat Archilochi musam pede mascula Sappho,
Temperat Alcaeus ,· sed rebus et ordine dispar,

Nec socerum quaerit, quem versibus oblinat atris, 30
N ec sponsae laqueum famoso carmine nectit.

Hunc ego, non alio dictum prius ore, Latinus

carmen ad Italos (ledaoeisse modos.”—·2-2. Non aliena meo pressi pede :
Supply vestiam. ‘⁶ Ι trod not in the footsteps of σώθηθ’-23. Parios
iambos. ⁴⁶ The Parian iambics 3⁸⁹ i. e. the iambics of Archilochus, who
was a native of Paros, and the inventor of this species of verse.—
24. Numeros animosque secutus Archilochi, δίο. “ Having imitated the
numbers and spirit of Archilochus ; not, however, his subjects, and his
language, that drove Lycambes to despair.” Consult note on Epode
vi. 13.—‘26. Foliis brevioribus. “ With more fading bays ;'' fiterassy,
“with leaves of shorter duration.'' Horace, in this passage, means
to convey the idea, that his imitation of Archilochus ought not to
be regarded as detracting from his own fame, since both Sappho
and Alcaeus made the same poet the model of their respective imitation.
-28, Temperat .=1›·eliiloclzz· musam, διο. “The masculine an'd vigorous
Sappho tempers her own effus'ions by the numbers of Archilochus:
Alcaeus tempers hisff' Temperat is here equivalent to moderantur et
componunt; and the idea intended to be conveyed is, that both Sappho
and Alcaeus bleud in some degree the measures of Archilochus with
their own 3 or, as Bentley expresses it, ‘⁶ Scias utrumque Archilocheos
numeros suis Lyricis immiscere.” Sappho is styled mascula from the
force and spirit of her poetry.-29. Sed rebus et ordine dispar. “But
he differs from him in his subjects, and in the arrangement of his
measures.’' Alcaeus employed. it is true, some of the mensures used
by Archilochus, but then he differed from him in arranging them with
other kinds of verse. Compare the language of Bentley: “Adscivit
Alcaeus metra quaedam Archilochi, sed ordine variavit, sed aliis ac ille
fecerat metris aptavit ea et comtemnit, ut dactylicum illud, Arboribusque
comae, cum Hemmetro jzmoeit Alcaeus, at eundem Iambo comitem dedit
Archiloclius.”—30. Nec socerum quaerit, ἃς. alluding to the story of
Archilochus and Lycambes. Compare Epode vi. 13.—31. Famoso car-
mine. ‘⁶ By defamatory strains.'' The allusion in the term sponsae is
to N eobule, the daughter of Lycambes.

32, 33. II unc eyo, non alio dictum prius ore, Sec. “ This poet, never
celebrated by any previous tongue, Ι the Roman lyrist first made known
to my countrymen ;“’ i. e. Ι alone, of all our bards, have dared to make
this Aleaeus known to Roman ears, and my reward has been that
