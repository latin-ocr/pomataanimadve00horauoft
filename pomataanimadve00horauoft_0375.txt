tine and Palatine hills.— Vespertinumquc sorum. The forum, at even-
iug, must have been the scene of many curious adventures, as it was the
common place of resort sor the idlcrs among the lower orders. Horace
csteems it one of the peculial· pleasurcs of his humble situation, as a private
individual, that he can iningle unnoticed with the crowds of the populace,
amuse himself with their various modes of diversion, and stroll wherever
he pleases through the lanes aud by-ways of the capital. This, one of
higher rank could not do, without being noticcd and insultem—114. Divi-
nis. “ The s01-tune-telle1-s.”

115—118. 115. Lafflmi. ‘⁴ Pancakcs. ” — 116. Pueris tribus.
Namely, a cook, a structor, or slave who laid the table, and brought on
the viands, and a pocillator, or cup-beare1·.—Lapis albus. The scholiast
Acron explains this by “ mensa marmorea ‚· ” but Fea shows very
conclusively‚ that the reference here is to a species of marble stand, with
holes cut in for the purpose of receiving drinking-caps, and other vessels of
this kind, which could not stand of themselves by reason of their spherical
bottoms.—ll7. Pocula cum cyatho duo. One of these cups held water,
the other wine, and the cyathus would be used for mixing the coutents of
the two.-——-Echinus. This term is commonly, though erroneously, sup-
posed to denote here a vessel in which the cups were washed. The truc
meaning, however, is “ a salt-cellar.”-—118. Guttus. “ A cruct.” A
small vessel, with a narrow neck, from which the liquor which it contained ,
issued by drops, (yuttatim‚) or else in very small quantities. It was chiefly
used in sacred rites, and is therefore classed here with the patera, or bowl
for offering libations.—Campana supellex. “ Campanian ware.'' The
pottery of Campania was always held in high estimation.

119—120. 119. Non sollicitus, milii quod cras, Soc. “ Disquieted
by no necessity of rising early the next moming, and visiting the statue
of Marsyas 3 '' literally, “not disturbed in mind because I must rise.”
&c. The poet means that he has no law-suit, nor any business what-
ever connected with the courts, that will disturb his slumbers over night,
and require his attendance early in the morning-120. Marsya. A
statue of Marsyas, the satyr, who contendcd with Apollo for the prize in
music, and was flayed alive by the conqueror, stood in the Roman forum,
in front of the rostra. The story of Marsyas presents a remarkable instance
of well-merited punishment inflicted on reckless presumption ; and as this
feeling is nearly allied to, if not actually identified with, that arrogant and
ungovernable spirit which formed the besetting sin of the ancient demo-
cracies, we need not wonder that, in many of the cities of antiquity, it was
customary to erect a group of Apollo and Marsyas in the vicinity of their
courts of justice, both to indicate the punishment which such conduct
