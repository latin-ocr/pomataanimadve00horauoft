Rem potem serrare inam. Redit uncia, quidfit 9-
Seruis—An, haec animos aerugo et cura peculi 330
Quum semel inibu« rit, speramus carmina fingi
Posse linenda cedro, et levi servanda cupresso .?

Aut prodesse volunt aut delectare poetae,
Aut simul et jucunda et idonea dicere vitae.
Quidquid praecipies, esto brevis, ut cito dicta 305
Percipiant animi dociles, teneantque fideles.
Omne supervacuum pleno dc pectore manat.
Ficta voluptatis causa sint proxima veris:
N e, quodcunque volet, poscat sibi fabula credi ;
Neu pransae Lamiae vivum puerum extrahat alvo. 340
Centuriae seniorum agitant expertia frugis ;

The teacher pursues his examination, hut takes care to put an easier
question, to which the boy gives the true answer: Semis; “Half-a—
pound.''

330—333. 3:30. Αη, haec αηίνῑτε aerugo et cura peculi, Sec. This
love of gain, observes Hurd, to which Horace imputes the imperfect
3tate of Roman poetry, has been uniformly assigned, by the wisdom of
ancient times, as the specific bane of arts and letters. Longinus and
Quintilian account, from hence, for the decay of eloquence, Galen of
physic, Petronius of painting, and Pliny of the whole circle of the liberal
ans—332. Linenda cedro, et leri servanda cupresso. 'she ancients, for
the better preservation of their manuscripts, rubbed them over with oil
of cedar, and kept them in cases of cypress.—-S33. Aut prodesse volunt
aut delectare po'e'aeae, διο. Horace here turns to notice another obstacle
which lay in the path of his countryrnen, and impeded their success in
poetry. This was their inattention to the entire scope and purpose of the
poetic art, while they contented themselves with the attainment of only
one of the two great ends which are proposed by it. For the double de-
sign of poetry being to instruct and please, the full aim and glory of the
art cannot be attained without uniting thern both 3 that is, instructing so
as to please, and pleasing so as to instruct. Under either head of instruc-
tion and entertainment, the poet, with great address, insinuates the main
art of each kind of writing, which consists, l. in instructius or didactic-
poetry (from 3:35 to 338), in conciseness af precept ,· and, 2. in works of
fancy and entertainment (line 338 to 341), in probability qffictiaem. But
both these (line 341 to 347) must concur in a just picce.

Lamiae vivam puerum, διο. 3 alluding probably to some drama of the
time, exhibiting so monstrous and horrible an incIdent.-341. Certim-iae
seniorum agitant expertia fragis. “The centuries of the old drive off
pieoes that are devoid of instruction.'' By the ‘⁴ centuries of the old,''
are meant the old generally, centuria being frequently used for an
indefinite number. Agitant is equivalent here to abigunt, exsibilans.—
