EPxSToLA AD PlsoNEs. 626

Indignor, quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus.

Verum operi longo fas est obrepere somnum. 360
Ut pictura, poesis: erit quae, si propius stes,

Te capiet magis, et quaedam, si longius abstcs.

Haec amat obscurum ; volet haec sub luce videri,

Judicis argutum quae non formidat acumen τ

Haec placuit semel, haec decies repetita placebit. 365
Ο major juvenum, quamvis et voce patema

Fingeris ad rectum, et per te sapis, hoc tibi dietum

Tolle memor: certis medium et tolerabile rebus

Recte concedi : consultus juris et actor

Causarum mediocris abest virtute diserti 370

· Messalae, nec scit quantum Cascellius Aulus 3

Sed tamen in pretio est : mediocribus esse poetis
Non homines, non di, non concessere columnae.

note on Epist. 11. i. 233.—358. Quem bis terve bouum cum risu miror.
“ Whom, when tolerable in two or three instances, Ι wonder at with
laughter.''—359. Quandoque. Put for quandocunque.

361—367. 361. Ut pictura, poesis, διο. Horace here goes on, (from
line 360 to 366‚) to observe in favour of writers, against a too rigorous.
criticism of their productionS, that what were often called lauhs, were
not so in reality; that some parts of a poem ought to be less shining‚ or
less finished, than others, according to the light they were placed in, οι·
the distance from which they were viewed3 and that, serving only to
connect and lead to others of greater consequence, it was sufficient if
they pleased once, or did not displease, provided that those others would
please on every revieW. All this is said agreeably to vulture, which does
not allow every part osa subject to be equally susceptible of ornament ;
and to the end of poetry, which cannot so well be attained without an in·
equality. The allusions to paint=ng, which the poet use5‚ give this
truth the happiest illustration.—366. Ο major jacentem, διο. Addressed
to the elder of the young Pisos. With major supply παίω-367. Et per
te sapis. “ And art able of thyself to form correct judgruents of things.”
Equivalent to et per te sapienter· ι]”ιιάιί·ιιε.-Ποο tien· dictum tolle memor.
‘⁸ Yet receive the precept which I here give thee, and treasure it up in
thy remembrance3 that, in certain things, mediocrity and a passable
degree of eminence are rightly enough allowed.'’

370—373. 370. Abest virtute diserti Messalae, &a ‘⁴ Wants the
talent of the eloquent Messala, and possesses not the legal erudition of
Cascellius Aulus.’' The poet, with great delicacy, throws in a com-
pliment to two distinguished individuals of the day.-372. Medio-
cribus. A Graecism t'or mediocres, the accusative—373. Columnae.
“ Booksellers' columns.’‘ Consult note on Sat. 1. iv. 71. Every thing,
according to Horace, declaFes against a niediocrity in poeti-y: Men
reject it, the gods, Apollo, Bacchus, and the Muses, disavow it; aud
