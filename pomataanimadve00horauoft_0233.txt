duleus hope of mutual affection ς ” i. e. the fond bnt fallacious hope that
my affection will be returned—34. Rara. “ Imperceptibly.’'—35. Cur
sacundaparum decoro, ἃς. The order is, cur facunda linqua cadit
inter verba parum decoro silentio. A synapheia takes place in decoro,
the last syllable ro being elided , before Inter at the beginning of the next
lim—36. Cadit. Gallo has here the meaning of “ to falte1·.”

Ons IL—Thc Sygambri, Usipetes, and Tenctheri, who dwelt beyond the
Rhine, having made frequent inroads into the Roman territory, Augustus
proceeded against them, and, by the mere terror of his name, cornpelled
them to sue for peace. (Dio Cassius, liv. 20. vol. 1. p. 750. ed. Rei-
mar.) Horace is therefore requested by Iulus Antonius, the same year
in which this event took place, (A. U. C. 738‚) to celebrate in Pindaric
strain the successful expedition of the emperor, and his expected return
to the mpital. The poet, however, declines the task, and alleges want of
alent as an excuse3 bnt tho very language in which this plea is comeyed,
shows how well qualified he was to execute the undertaking from which he
shrinks.

Iulus Antonius was the son of Marc Antony and Fulvia. He stood high
in the favour of Augustus, and received from him his sister's daughter in
marriage. After having filled, however, some of the most important
offices in the state, he engaged in an inti-igue with Julia, the daughter of
the emperor, and was put to death by order of the latter. According to
Velleius Paterculns, (ii. 100‚) he fell by his own hand. It would appear
that hc had formed a plot, along with the notorious female just mentioned,

against the life of Augustus.
