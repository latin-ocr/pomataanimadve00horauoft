CARMINUM Lm. 11. 5. 93

Nescias, an te generum beati

Phyllidis flavae decorent parentes :

Regium certe genus et Penates 15
Moeret iniquos.

Credo non illam tibi de scelesta
Plebe delectam ; neque sie fidelem,
Sic lucro aversam, potuisse nasei
Matre pudenda. 20

Brachia et vultum teretesque suras

Integer laudo : fuge suspicari,

Cujus octavum trepidavit aetas
Claudere lustrum.

CARMEN V.

N oNDtm subacta ferre jugum valet
Cerviee, nondum munia comparis
Aequare, nec tauri ruentis
In Venerem tolerare pondus.

Circa virentes est animus tuae 5
Campos juvencae, nunc fluviis gravem
Solantis aestum, nunc in udo
Ludere cum vitulis salicto

whose age is hastening onward to bring its eighth lustrum to a close.’'
A lustrum was a period of five years, so that the poet must now have
been in his sortieth year. The phrase claudere, or condere, lustrum,
properly refers to the sacrifice called Suovetaurilia or Solitamilia, which
closed the census, the review of the people taking place every lustrum, or
at the end of every five years.
