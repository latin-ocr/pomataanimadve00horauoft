SERMONUM LIB. 11. 3. 395

Praetor, et ad sanos abeat tutela propinquos.

Quid? si qui gnatam pro muta devovet agna,

Integer est animi? Ne dixeris. Ergo ibi prava ‘220
Stultitia, haec summa est insania: qui sceleratus,

Et furiosus erit ; quem cepit vitrea fama,

Hunc circumtonuit gaudens Bellona cruentis.

Nunc age, luxuriam et Nomentanum arripe mecum.
Vincet enim stultos ratio insanire nepotes. 225
Hic simul accepit patrimoni mille talenta,

Edicit, piscator uti, pomarius, auceps,

Unguentarius ac Tusci turba impia vici,

Cum scurris fartor, cum Velabro omne macellum

Mane domum veniant. Quid tum? Venere frequentes. ‘230
Verba facit leno ε Quidquid mihi, quidquid σε lteram

sions and epithets which suit only the Roman state—221. Qui scelera-
tus, et jur-iosus erit. ‘⁶ He who is wicked will also be mad ;'' i. e. every
wicked man is at the same time a madman.-‘2·22. Quem cepit vitrea
fama, Sec. “ Arouncl the head of him whom glittering fame has capti-
vated, Bellona, delighting in soenes of bloodshed‚ has rolled her thun-
ders ;'' i. ε. the man whom a love of glory seizes, is also mad, for that
glory can only be attained by wading through seas of blood. Consult,
as regards the epithet vitrea, the note on Ode 1. xvii. 20. As regards the
expression circumtonuit, it may be remarked, that the ancients ascribed
to thunder a maddenin'g or deranging influence on the mind. Hence,
the words hunc circumtonuit Bellona, become, in a free translation,
equivalent to,‘· him Bellona h'as thundered out o⁷f his senses, and plunged
into srenzv.’'

224-2‘29. 224. Nunc age, luaeuriam, διο. Stertinius, intending next
to prove that spendthrists and prodigals are mad, returns to Nomentanus,
whom he had brought upon the scene in the 175th verse.—Arripe.
‘⁸ Arraign.'’——2·25. Vincet. ‘⁴ Will prove ;‘' equivalent to argumentis
probabit—228. Tusci turba impia vici. ‘⁴ The worthless crew of the
Tusean street.'’ The Tuscan street was a little to the south of the
Vicus Juyarius, and consequently nearer the Palatine. It appears to
have led from the forum to that part of the city called the Velabrum,
and from thence to the Circus lilaximus:—2·29. Fertor. “ The poul-
terer ;” literally, “the fowl-crammer.” The term fartor also denotes
“a sausage-maker,'' ἀλλαντοπώλης-(ἧφι Velabro. “With the ven-
ἀει-5 of the Velabrum ;'’ i. e. with those who sell various kinds of food in
the quarter of the city denominated Velabrum. The name of Velabrum
was applied generally to all the ground which lies on the lest bank of the
Tiber, between the base of the Capitol and the Aventine. —Macellum n.
Under this name were comprehended the various market- -places where
different commodities were sold. These were all contiguous to one
another, along the Tiber.

231—246. 231. Verba facit leno. “ The pimp speaks for the rest.’'
