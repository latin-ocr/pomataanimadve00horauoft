EPISTOLA Αῐ) PISONES 587

Porphyrion, was, that it comprehended precepts on the art in general,
but that these had been collected from the works of Aristotle, Neopto·
lemus of Paros, and other (welz critics, and had been strung together
by the Latin poet in such u manner as to firm a inedley of rules with-
out any systematic plan or arrangement. 'l'his notion was adopted by
the commentators who flourislz'ed after the revival of literature, as
Robortellus‚ „lason de Nores, und the elder Scaliger, who coneum-ed
in treating it as a loose, vague, aud desultor: composition3 and this
opinion continued ιο prevail in Franco as late' ns the time of Dacier.
Others have conceived that the epistle under consideration comprises
a complete system of poetrv‚ and flatter themselves they can trace iu
it, from beginning to end, a regular and connected plan. 1). Heinsius
stands at the head of this class, and he maintains that, wherever we
meet with an apparent confusion or irregularity, it has been occasioned
hythe licentious transpositions of the copyists. The improbability,
however, that such a wrner would throw out his precepts at random,
and the extreme difficulty, ou the other hand, of reducing it to a regu-
lar and systematic treatise on poetry, with perfect coherence in all its
parts, have induced ether critics to believe, either that this piece
contains but fragments of what Horace designed, which was Pope‘s
opinion, or that the author had only an aim at one department of poe-
try, or class ofpoets. Of all the them-ies on this subject, the most
celebrated in its dav, though now supplanted by the theory of Wie-
land, is that which ‘refers everything to the history and progress of
the Roman drama, and its actual condition in the author's time. Lam-
binus, and Baxter, in his edition of Horace, had hinted at this notiori,
which has been fully developed by Hurd, in his excellent commentary
and notes on the present epistle, where he undertakes to show, that
not only the general tenor of the work, but every single precept, bears
reference to the drama3 and that, if examined in this point of view,
it will be found to be a regular, well-conducted piece, uniformly tend-
ing to lay open the state and remedy the defects of the Roman stage.
According to this critic, the subject is divided into three portions:
Of these, the first (from verse 1 to 89.) is preparatory to'the main
subject of·tl.e epistle, containing some general rules and reflections on
poeti-y, but principnlly with a view to the succeeding parts, by which
means it serves as a useful introduction to the poet’s design, and
opens it with that air of ease and neglig-enee essential to the episto-
lary form. Qd, The main body of the epistle (from verse 89 to 295.)
is laid out in regulating the Roman stage, and chiefly iu giving rules
for tragedy‚ not only as that was the sublimet species of the drama,
but, as it should seem, the least cultivated and understood. Sd, The
last. portion (from verse 295 to the end) exhorts to correctness in
writing‚ and is occupied partly in explaining the causes that prevented
it, and partlv in directing to the use of such means as might serve to
promote it. ‘Such is the general plan of the epistle, according to Hurd,
who maintains that, in order to enter fully into its scope, it is neces-
sary to trace the poet attentively through all the elegant connexione

of his own method.

Sanadon, and a late German critic, M. Engel, have supposed, that
the great purpose of Horace, in the present epistle was to ridicule the
