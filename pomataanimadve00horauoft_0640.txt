596 Q,- HORATII FLACGI

Regis opus 3 sterilisve diu palus aptaque remis 65
Vicinas urbes alit, et grave sentit aratrum ;
Seu cursum mutavit iniquum frugibus amnis,
Doctus iter melius. Mortalia facta peribunt :
Nedum sermonum stet honos et gratia vivax.
Multa renascentur quae jam cecidere, cadentque 70
Quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usus7
Quem penes arbitrium est et jus et nofflffljoquendi.
Res gestae regumque ducumque et tristia bella
Quo scribi possent numero, monstravit Homerus.
Versibus impariter junctis querimonia primum, 75
Post etiam inclusa est voti sententia compos,

on verse 63 · ‚the checking, namely, of the inundations of the Tiber.

73-78. 73. Res gestae regumque dncmnque, &c. From reflections
on poetry at Ian-ge, Horace now proceeds to particulars,· the most
obvious of which being the different forms und mensures of poetic
compositio-ns he consi ders, in this view (from line 75 to 86), the four
giert species of poetry, to which all others may be reduced, the Epic,
Elegiae, Dramatic, and Luiic. —74 Q1107mme10“ In what numbers
i. e. in whatkindof measure. „75 Versibus impariter junctis‚· referring
to Elegiae verse, and the alternate succession, in its structure, of
Hexameters and Pentanieters. —Quen'mania primum. Horace goes on

and Pentameters was first of all made the vehicle of mournful themes,
