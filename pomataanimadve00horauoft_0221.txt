CARMINUM LIB· 111. 27. 181

Sed vides, quanto trepidet tumultu

Pronus Orion. Ege, qnid sit ater

Adriae, novi, sinus, et quid albus

” Peccet Iispyx. 20

Hostium uxores puerique caecos

Sentiant motus orientis Austri, et

Aequoris nigri fremitum, et trementes
Verbere ripas.

Sic et Europe niveum doloso 25
Credidit tauro latus ; at scatentem
Belluis pontum mediasque fraudes

Palluit audax.

Among the Romans, birds that gave omens by their notes were called
ῃΟερῂιεες, and those from whose flight angui-ies were drawn received the
appellation of Praepetes. The cry of the raven, when heard from the
meast, was deemed favourable.—10. merium divina aris imminentem.
The crow is here meant.—l3. Sis lieet selim. “ Mayest thou be happy.”
The train of ideas is as follows: I oppose not thy wishes, Galatea, It is
permitted thee, as far as depends on me, or on the omens which Ι am
taking, to be happy wherever it may please thee to mvelt—15. Laevus
picus. “ A woodpccker on the left.” YVhen the Romans made omens
on the left unlucky, as in the present instance, they spoke in accordance
with tlse Grecian custom. The Grecian augurs, when they made obser-
vatione, kept⁸their faces towards the north3 hence they had the east or
lucky quarter of the heavens on their right hand, and the west on their
left. On the contrary, the Romans, making observations with their faces
to the south, had the east upon their left hand, and the west upon their
right. ’ Both sinister and laevus therefore have, when we speak Romano
more, the meaning of lucky, fortunate, &c., and the opposite import when
we speak Graeco more.

17—39. 17. Quanto trepidet tumultu, &m “ With what a lond and
stormy noise the setting Orion hastens to his rest ;'' i. e. what tempests
are preparing to burst forth, now that On'on sets. Consult note on Ode
1. xxviii. 2l.-—19. Novi ‚⁴ alluding to his own personal experience. He
knows the dangers of the Adriatic, because hc has seen them—Et quid
albus peccet Iapyoe. “ And how ‹lcceitful the serene Iapyx is.'’ As
regards the epithet albus, compare Ode 1. vii. 153 and with regard to the
term Iapyx, consult note on Ode 1. iii. 4.—21. caecos motus. “ The
dark commotions.’'—24. Verbere. ‘⁴ Beneath the lashing of the surge ;’'
understand fluctuum.—25. Sic. “ With the same rashness.”——Europe ,·
the Greek form for Europam—26. At scatentem belluis, διο. “ But,
though bold before, she now grew pale at the deep, teeming with mon-
eters, and at the fraud and danger that everywhere met the view.”
The term fraudes, in this passus-vc, denotes properly danger rcsulting to
an individual from fmud and artifice on the part of another, a meaning
which we have endeavoured to express.—-28. Palluit. This verb here
