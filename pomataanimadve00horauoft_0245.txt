CARMINL'M L113. lv. 5. 203>

Condit quisque diem collibus in suis‚
Et vitem viduas ducit ad arbores: 30
Hinc ad vina venit lactus, ct alteris

Te mensis adhibet deum z

Te multa prece, te prosequitur mero

Desuso pateris: et Laribus tuum

Miscet numen, uti Graecia Castoris 35
Et magni memor Herculis.

Longas o utinam, dux bone, ferias
Praestos Hesperiae ἱ dicimus integro
Sicci manc die, dicimus uvidi,
Quum Sol occano subest. 40

have we, therefore, now to dread ἓ As regards the Parthians, consult notes
on Ode 1. xxvi. 3, and ιιι. v. 3.—-Gel1clum Scythen. “ Thc Scythian,
the tenant of the North.” By the Scythiaus are here meant thc hau-burnus
tribvs in the vicinity of the Danube, but more particularly the Geloni.
Their inroads had been checked by Lentulus, the lieutenant of Augustus.
-26. Quis, Germania quos horrida, ἃς. “ Who, the broods that
horrid Germany brings forth 'i'' The epithet horrida has reference, iu
fact, to the wild and savage appearance, and the great stature, of Jhc
ancient Germans. It contains an allusion also to the wild nature of thc
country, and the severity of the climate.—-29. Condit quisque diem, &c.
“ Each one closes the day ou his own hill÷.‘’ Under the auspicious
reign of Augustus all is peace3 no war calls off thc vine-dresser from his
vineyard, or the husbandmau from his fields.—30. Viduas ad arbores.
⁴⁴ To the. widowed trees ;” a beautiful allusion to the check given to agri-
culture by the civil ivam-31. Et alteris te mensis, διε. “ And at tho
second table invokes thee as a god.'' The coe-na of the Romans usually
consisted of two parts,—the mensa prima, or first course, composed of
different kinds of meat, and the mensa secunda or altera, second course.
consisting of fruits and sweetmeats. The wine uas set down on the table
with the dessert 3 and, before they began drinking, libations were pour-ed
out to the gods. This, by a dccree of the senato, was done also in honour
of Augustus, after the battle of Actium—33. Prosequitur. ‘⁶ He wor-
ships.’'—34. Et Laribus tuum, &c- “‚And blends thy protecting divi·
nity with that· of the Lares, as grateful Greece does those of Castor and the
mighty Hercules.'’ The Lares here alludod to are the Lares Publici, or
Dii Patrii, supposed by some to be identical with the Penates.—37. Lon-
9as o utinam, &c- ‘⁴ Auspicious prince, maycst thou afford long festal
days to Italy ;'' i. e. long maycst thou rule over ufir—38. Dicimus integro,
δῖε. “ For this we pray‚ in sober mood, at early dawn, while the day iu
still entire ; for this we pray, moistened with the juice of the grape, when
the sun is sunk beneath the ocean.’' Jnteyer dies is a day of which no
part has as yet been used.
