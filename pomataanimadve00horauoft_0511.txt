EPISTOLARUM LIB. 1. 3. 469

Frigida curarum fomenta relinquere posseS,

Quo te coelestis sapientia duceret, ires.

Hoc opus, hoc studium parvi properemus et ampli,

Si patriae volflmus, si nobis vivere cari.

Debes hoc etiam rescribere, si tibi curae, 30
Quantae conveniat, Munatius 3 an male sarta

Gratia nequidquam coit et rescinditur? At, vos

Seu calidus sanguis seu rerum inscitia vexat

Indomita cervice seros, ubicunque locorum

Viu’fis, indigni fraternum rumpere foedus, 35
Pascitur in vestrum reditum votiva juvenca.

ederae victricis praemia. Compare Ode 1. i. ita—26. Frigida cura-
rum fomenta. “The cold fomentors of care.'' A beautiful expression.
The poet is alluding to ambition, and to a love of riches: these increase
our cares, and at the sanic time render the breast cold and dead to the
lessons of virtue, and the inspirations of poetry.—-‘.28. Hoc opus, hoc
stadium alluding to the practice of virtue and wisdom.

30—36. 30. Si tibi curae, quantae conveniat, sslunatius. “Whe-
ther thou hast still that regard for Munatius which becomes thee ;” i. e.
whether thou art still on the same terms of friendship with one, between
whom and thee there never ought to have been the least variance. The
indjvidual here styled Munatius is thought to have been the son of that
Munatius Plancus who was consul A. U. C. 712, and to whom the 7th
Ode of the first book is addressed. The son himself obtained the consul-
ship A. U. C. 766. There would seem to have been a difference
between the latter and Florus, which their common friends had united
themselves to heal. Such forced reconciliations, however, are generally
as little durable as sincere, and the poet therefore is afraid lest this one
may soon be interrupted.—3l. An male sarta qratia nequidquam coit et ·
rescinditur? “ Or does the ill-sewu reconciliation close to no purpose,
and is it getting again rent asunder ?'' We have translated the expres-
sion male sarta literally‚ in order to preserve more effectually t’ne force of
the allusion. The reference is to a wound badly sewn up, and which
begins to bleed afresh.—-33. Calidas sanquis. ‘⁶ The hot blood of
youth.'⁴—Inscitia rerum. “ want of experience.”—34. Indomita cer-
vice. “With untamed neck.”—35. Indiyni. “Too wonhy.”-Fra-
ternum rumpere foedus. Dacier thinks that Florus and Munatius were
brothers by the mother's side, and sees no reason, from the difference of
nameS, why they might not also be brothers by the father's side, as
Murena and Proculeius. Sanadon, however, makes them entirely differ-
ent families 3 and says, that the expressions employed in the text mean
no more than that Florus and Munatius had formerly loved one another
as brothers. This is certainly the more correct opinion.-36. In ves-
trum reditum. “ Against your return.'’ The use of vestrum here im-
plies that the poet wishes them to return not only in safety‚ but as
ffiends. For this the votive sacrifice is to be offered, and the promised
entertainment given.
