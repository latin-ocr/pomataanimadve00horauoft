EPISTOLA XVII.
AD SCAEVAM.

QUAMVIS, Scaeva, satis per te tibi consulis, et scis,
Quo tandem pacto deceat majoribus uti,

covetous feelings. Captivos might either be put to death or sold, and
the poet humorously recommends the latter course, or else that he be
retained and made useful in some way—70. Sine pascat durus, aretque.
‘⁶ Let him lead the hard life of a shepherd or a ploughman.”—-7·2.
Annonae prosit. “ Let him contribute to the cheapness of grain ;” z‘. e.
by his laborm—Penusque. “ And other provisions.'’

73—79. 73. Vir bonus et sapie-11³, &a Aster rejecting the several
false notions of virtue which have just passed in review, the poet now
lays down the position, that the truly good and wise man is he whom
the loss of fortune, liberty, and life cannot intimidate. With unexpeeted
spirit and address he brings a god upon the stage, in the character of
this good man, instead of giving a formal defiuition. The whole passage
is imitated from the Bacchae of Euripides, (484. seqq.) where Pentheus,
king of Thebes, threatens Bacchus with rough usage and with chains.—
Pentheu, ‘rector Thebarum, ecc. Bacchus speaks—75. iVempe pecus,

money ; thou mayest take theni.’‘-78. Ipse (leus, simul atque volam,
διο. “ A god will come in person to deliver me, as soon as Ι shall
desire it.''-——Opinor, hoc sentit, &e ²⁴ In my opinion, he means this: 1
will die. Death is the end of our race.'' In the Greek play, Bacchus
means that he will ‹leliver himself, and 'when he pleases. Horace, there-
fore, in his imitation of the Greek poet, abandons the idea just alluded
to, and explains the words conformably to his own design of showing,
that the sear even of death is not capable of shaking the cour-age of a
good man, or of obliging him to abandon the cause of virtue—79. ,Mors
ultima linea rerum est. A figurative allusion to chariot taces. Linea
was a white rope drawn across the circus, and serving to mark both the
beginning and the eud of the raee.

Emsun XVII.-—Horace, in this epistle‚ gives his young friend some
instructions for his conduct at court, that he may not only support his
own character there, but proceed with happiness in that dangerous and
