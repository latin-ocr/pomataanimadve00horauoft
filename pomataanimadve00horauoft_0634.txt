reign. Of all tbe modern Arts of Poetry, Boileau’s is the best. It
is remarkable for the brevity ofits precepts, the exactness of its me-

and it proved of the utmost utility to his own nation‚ in diffusing a
just mode of thinking and writing‚ in banishing every species of false
wit, and introducing a pure [aste for the simplicity of the ancients.
Boileau, at the conclusion of his last book, avows, and glories as it
were in the charge, that his work is founded on that of Horace.

“ Pour moi, qui jusqu'ici nourri dans la satire,
N’ose encore manier la Trompem¹ et la Lyre ,

1-14, 1. Humano capiti cervicem pictor equinam, &a The epistle
begins with the general and fundamental precept of preserving an unity
in the subject and disposition of every piece. A poet, who neglects
this leading principle, and produces a work, the several parts of which
have no just relati-»n to each other or to ore grand whole, is compared
to a painter‚ who puts on canvas a form of Interogeneous character,
its members taken from all kinds of animals. Both are equally deserv-
