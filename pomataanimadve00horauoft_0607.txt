last and noblest exercise of human genius—.. 009. Laudare malnyrzc,
‘⁴ Condemn by faint praise. ”—·210. Ille per· euentum funem mihi posse
videtur ire poeta. “That poet appears to me able to w zlk upon th Δ
tight rope; ’ i. e. able to do any thing, to accomplish the most diffie-ult
undertakings' m his art. The Romans, who were immoderately addicted
to spectacles of every kind, had in particular esteem the funambuli,
m· rope-duncers. From the admiration excited by their feats, the
expmion, ire per extentum funem, came to denote proverbially, nn
uncommon degree of excellence and perfectiori in any thing. The
allusion is here made with much pleasantry, as the poet had just been
mllying his countrymen on their fondness for these extraordinary
achievements.—2ll. Meum (μα’ pectus inaniter anyit. “ Who turtures
my bosom by his unreal creations ;” i. e. by his fictions.—-·211. Falsis
terroribus implet. According to Hurd, the word inaniter, on which we
have already remarked, as well as the epithet falsis, applied to terroribus,
would express that wondrous force of dramatic- representation, which
oempels us to take part in seigned adventures and situations as if
they were real ; and exercises the passions with the same violence in
remote fancied soenes, as in the present distresses of actual life—214.
Verum aye, et his, qui se lectori crede-re malunt, &c. As regards the con-
nexion in the train of ideas, compare the remarks of Hurd: “One
thing still remained. Horace had taken upon himself to apologize for
the Roman poets in general; but after an encomium on the office
itself, he confines his defence to the writers for the stage only. In
conclusion then, he was constrained, by the very purpose of his address,
1ο say a word or two in behalf of the remainder of this 'neglected
family—of those who, as the poet expresses it, had rather trust to the
· equity of the closet, than subject themselves to the caprice and insolence of
the theatro- Now, as before in asserting the honour of the stage-mets,
he every where supposes the emperor's disgust to have sprung froin
the wrong conduct of the poets themselves, and then extenuates the ῑ
blame of such conduct by considering, still further, the causes which
gave rise to it ; so he prudently observes the same method here. The
politeness of his addresses concedes t0,A11gustus the just offence hc
had taken to his brother poets; whose honour, however, he contrives·
to save, by softening the occasions of it. This is the drift ofwvhat
follows, (from line :214 to 229) where he pleasantly recounts the several
soibles and indiscretions of the muse ; but in a way that could only
dispose the emperor to smile at, or, at most, to pity her infirmities, not
provoke his serious censure and disesteem. They amount, on the whole,
but to certain idlenesses of vanity, the almost inseparable attendants of
wit as well as beauty; and may be forgiven in each, as implying a
strong desire to please, or rather as qualifying both to please. One of
the most exeeptionable of these vanities was va fond persuasion, too
readily taken up by rnen of parts and genius, that preferment is the
