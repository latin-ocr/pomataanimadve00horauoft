3η “ · ’ Q.· nonATu FLAch

Infernas errare canes, Lunamque rubentem, 35
Ne foret his testis, post magna latere sepulcra.

Mentior at si quid, merdis caput inquiner albis

Corvorum, atque in me veniat mictum atque cacatum
Julius, et fragilis Pediatia, furque Voranus.

Singula quid memorem? quo pacto alterna loquentes 40
Umbrae cum Sagana resonarent triste et acutum ξ

thue lupi barbam variae cum dente colubrae

Abdiderint furtim terris, et imagine cerea

Largior arserit ignis, et ut non testis inultus

Horruerim voces Furiarum et facta duarum? 45
Nam, displosa sonat quantum vesica, pepedi

Diffissa nate ficus: at illae currere in urbem.

Canidiae dentes, altum Saganae caliendrum

Excidere, atque herbas, atque incantata lacertis

Vincula, cum magno risuque jocoque videres. 50

poet seizes the present opportunity of lashing some of the abandoned
characters of the day. The first of these, Julius, was a man of infamous
mora1s; the second was not more pure3 and, to mark his extreme cor-
ruption, a female name is given him, his true one having been Pediatius.
41—48, 41. Umbrae. The manes evoked by the incantations of
the sorceress.—Res0narent triste et acutum. The spirits of the ‘dead
are here represented, in accordance with the popular belief, as uttering
a plaintive and shrill sound when speaking—42. Lupi barbam. Pliny
(Hist. Nat. xxviii. 10) informs us, that the snout of a wolf (rostrum
lupi) was thought to possess the greatest virtue in repelling enchanttnents,
and was therefore fimi up over the doors of farm-houses. The modern
belief respecting the efficacy of the horse—shoe is akin to this. On the
present occasion, the hags bury a wolf ' s heard, in order to guard their own
enchantments against any counter charm.—43. Cerea. To be pronounced,
in metrica] reading, cer-ya. Compare Serm. 11. ii. 21, where a similar
