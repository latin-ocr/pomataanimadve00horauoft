328 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Namque esto, populns Laevino mallet honorem
Quam Decio mandare novo, censorque moveret 20
Appius, ingenuo si non essem patre natus 3
Vel merito, quoniam in propria non pelle quiessem.
Sed fulgente trahit constrictos gloria curru
Non minus ignotos generosis. Quo tibi, Tilli,
Sumere depositum clavum, fierique tribuno? 25
Invidia accrevit, privato quae minor esset.
Nam ut quisque insanus nigris medium impediit crus
Pellibus et lat-um demisit pectore clavum,
Audit continuo: Quis homo hic? et quo patre natus ἓ

20-23. 20. Decio novo. ‘⁸ To a new man like Decius.'' The
term Decio is here used as a species of appellative: 50, in the preceding
line, Laevino must be rendered “to a Laevinus.'' The allusion in the
words Decio novo is to P. Decius Mus, (Livy, viii. 9‚) who, like Cicero,
was the first of his family that attained to a. curule office.—Censor
Appius. “ Α censor like Appius.” The poet alludes to Appius Clau-
dius Pulcher, who was censor A. U. C. 702, and ejected many individuale
from the senate because they were the sons of freedmen.—2·2. Vel
merito. “ Deservedly would this even be done.’'-—In propria pelle.
“ 111 my own skin,” i. e. in my own proper sphere.—23. Sed fulgente
trahit, ἃς. “But glory, thou wilt say, leads all men captive at the
wheels of her glittering car ;” an allusion, beautifully figurative, to the
triumphal chariot of a conqueror. 'she poet supposes some one to urge,
in extenuation of the conduct which he has just been condemning, the
strong and masteiing influence that a thirst for distinction exercises upon
all men, whatever their om‘gin or condition in life. To this he replies in
the next line, Quo tibi, Tilli, &c. by showing how little real pleasure
attends the elevation of the low-born, amid the sneers and frowns of the
very populace themselves, as well as of those into whose circle they have
thus intruded.

24—38. 24. Quo tibi, Tilli. “ Of what advantage has it been to
thee, Tillius.'’ Quo is here the old form for quoi, i. e. cui, and 'qno
tibi is equivalent to cuinam commodo tibi fuit, οι· quid tibi proficit.—
According to the scholiast, Tillius (or, as he writes the name, Tullius)
was removed from the senate by Caesar, for being 3 partisan of Pompey's.
After the assassination of Caesar, however, he regained his senato'rian
rank, and was made a military tribune. He was an individual of low
origia—25. Sumere depositum clavum. ‘⁴ To resume the latit-lave
which had been put off by theess’ The laticlave (latus clavus) was one
of the badges of a senator.-Tribnno. A Graecism for tribunum.—
26. Privato qnae minor esset. ‘⁴ Which would have been less to thee,
hadst thou remained 111 3 private station ;” i. e. which thou wouldst
have escaped, hadst thou remaincd in the obscurity to which thou
wast forced to return.—27. Nam ut quisque insanus, διε. “ For the
moment any vaiu and fuolish man covers his leg up to the middle with
the black buskins.” Among the badges of senatorian rank were black
buskins (here called uiyrae pelles, literally ‘⁴ black skins‚”) reaching
up to the middle of the leg, with the letter C iu silver on the top of
