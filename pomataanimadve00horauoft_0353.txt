in regular establishmcnts (tabernae librariae), or on shclvcs nround tho
pillais of porticoes and public buildings.—72. Queis mame ine. det, &c

qui, Sec. It is here objected to the poet, that, if he himself does not
openly recite satirical verses of his composing, yet there arc many who du
recite theirs, and that too even iu the forum and the bath ; selecting the
latter place in particular. because, “ being shut in on every side by walls,
it givesa pleasing echo to the voice.’¹ To this the poet replica, that such
persons are mere fools, and altogether ignorant of what propriety demands,
