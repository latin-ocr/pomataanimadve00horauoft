390 Q. HORATH FLACCI

Campana solitus trulla, vappamque profestis,
Quondam lethargo grandi est oppressus, ut heres 145
Jam circum loculos et claves laetus ovansque

Excitat hoc pacto: mensam poni jubet, atque
Effundi saccos nummorum, accedere plures

Ni tua custodis, avidus jam haec auferet heres.

trulla, but after it had been poured from such a vessel (made of ear-then-
ware and not of better materials) into the poculum or cup—147. Mul-
