the hereditary foe of kings, to accomplish. We may either understand
unum after operum tuorum, or, which is far preferable, makc the genitive
here an imitation at onec of the Greek idiom.

Srrmss vlu—The design of this Satire is to ridicule the superstitious
of the Romans. Priapus is introduced describing the incantations per—
formed by Canidia, in a gardcn on the Esquiline Hill, which he protected
from thieves. But hc could not guard it from the intrusion of Canidia and

a sister hag, who resortcd there for the celebration of their unhallowcd
rues.

1-11. l. Inutile liynum. The wood of the fig-trec was very little
used on account of its brittlencss. Hence the Greek proverb, ἀνήρ σύκινος,
“ Α fig-trec man‚'' to denote onc that is of little firmncss or real value.
-2. Incertus scamnum faceretne Priapum. Horace here represents
the carpenter (saber lignarius) as at a loss whether to make a bench οι· a
Priapus out of the wood in question. This of course is a mere witticisni
on the part of the poet, at the expense of the strange deity to whom In·
alludes.—3. Furum aviumque maaeima formido. A wooden figure of
Priapus was generally set up in gardens and orchards. He was usually
represented with a crown of reeds or of garden herbs, and holding in his
right hand a wooden club, or else seyme, whilst his body terininated in a
shapeless trunk. The Roman poets appear, in general, to have enter-
tained little, if any, respect for him3 and with the vulgar he degenere-ted
into a mere scare-crow‚ whose only employment seemed to be to drive away
the birds and thieves.·-4. Dextra ,· alluding to the club, or scythe, with
which his right hand was armed.—6. Arundo. Referring to his crown
of reeds, the rattling of which served to terrify the birds.—7. Novis
hortis. By the “ new gardens'’ arc herc meant those of Maecenas on
the Esquiline Hill, which were laid out on what had been previously a
common burying-placc for the lower orders, for slaves, and for ruined
spendthrifts.—8. Prius. Before the gardcns of Maecenas were laid out.
Anqustis ejecta cellis. ‘⁴ Tossed out of their narrow cells.'' The term
ejecta forcibly denotcs the unfecling manner in which the corpses of slaves
were disposed of. By cellis arc meant their little cells or dormitories.—
9. conservus. Compare the remark of Acron: “ Conservi locabant et
