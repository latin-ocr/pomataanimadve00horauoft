SERMONUM Lln. 1. S. '0¹45

Nee prohibere mod0‚ simul ac vaga Luna decorum

Protulit os, quin ossa legant herbasque nocentes.

Vidi egomet nigra succinctam· vadere palla

Canidiam, pedibus nudis, passoque capillo,

Cum Sagana majore ululantem. Pallor utrasque 35
Fecerat horrendas adspectu. Scalpere terrain

Unguibus, et pullam divellere mordicus agnam

Coeperunt: cruor in fossam confusus, nt inde

Manes elicerent, animas responsa daturas.

Lanea et effigies erat, altera cerea; major 30
Lanea, quae peonis compesceret inferiorem.

Cerea suppliciter stabat, servilibus ut quae

Jam peritura modis. Hecaten vocat altera, saevam
Altera Tisiphonen : serpentes atque videres

21—29. 21. l'aya Luna. The cpithct vaya, “wandering,’' is
merely applied to the moon in allusion to her course through the heavens.
-23, Niyra succinctam palla. ‘⁸ with her sable roho tucked up.⁷’--
25. Cum Sayana majore. “With the elder Sagana.” The scholiast
makes this Sagana to have been a frecdwoinan of Pomponius, a Roman
senator proscribed by the triumviratc, and to have had a sister younger than
herself; whence the epithet major (sc. natu) herc applied to her. Doring
thinks that Sagana may have been termed major by Horace, as being older
thau Caunum—26. Scalpere terram urz-quibus, ἃς. The witches are
here represented as digging a trcnch with their nans, and tcaring the
victim in pieccs with their tceth. This, of course, is invented by the
poet, in order to give a more ridiculous appearance to the whole scene.—
27. Pallam aynam. Black victims were always offered to the gods of
the lower worm—28. Inde. This may either refer to the trench or the
blood. The latter appears to us more correct, and inde will therefore be
equivalent to hac re, ¹‘ by means of this.” Nothing was supposed to be
more delicious to the souls of the departed than blood. They would not
foretell any future events, nor answer any questions, until they had tasted
orie—29. Manes. The Dei Asanes of course are meant.

30-39, 30. Lanea et effiyies erat, διο. There were two images.
one of larger size and made of wool, the other smaller and composcd of
wax. The former represented Canidia, the latter the intended victim of
the charm, and this one stood in a suppliant posture before the other, as
about to receive some signal punishment. The general rule in magic rites
seems to have been, to make the images of those who were to bc benefited
of wool, aud to employ wax in the case of those who were to be operated
upon. The wool was deemed invulnerablc, whereas the wax was either
pierced with needles, or was made to melt away in magic fires.——31.
Quae poenis compesceret inser-iorem. “ Which was to keep the smallcr
one within bounds by certain punishments3 ’' i. e. was to keep the indi-
vidual‚ whom the image represented, from wandering in his affectione hy
tho infliction of certain severe punishments.-32. Servilihus modis.
