186 Q. HORATII FLACCI (sm Ι
Jam dudum apud me est. Eripe te morae: 5
Ut semper-udum Tibur, et Aesulae

Declive contempleris arvum, et

Telegoni juga parricidae.

Fast'sdiosam desere copiam et
Molem propinquam nubibus arduis: 10

Omitte mirari beatae

Fumum et opes strepitumque Romae.

Plerumque gratae divitibus vices,
Mundae que parvo sub lare pauperum
Coenae, sine aulaeis et ostro, 15
Sollicitam explicuere frontem.

who possesses this need not tremble at the tempest that dissipates the
wealth of the trader.

as yet turned to be empticd of any part of its contents ;’' i. e. as yet un-
broached. The allusion is to the simplest mode practised among the
Romans for drawing off the contents of a wine-vessel‚ by inclining it to one
side, and thus pouring out the liquor.-4. Balanus. “Perfume.”
The name balanus, or myrobalanum, was given by the ancients to a
species of rig-t, from which a valuable unguent or pcrfume was extracted.
-5. Eripe te morae. “ Snatch thy-sels from delay;” i. e. from every
thing in the city that may seek to detain thee there: from all the en-
grossing cares of public life.-6. Ut semper-udum. The common text
has ne semper udum, which involves an absurdity. How could Mae-
cenaS, at Romo, contemplate Tibur. which was twelve or sixteen
miles off P--Tibmn Consult note Ode 1. vii. 13.—Aesulae declive
arvum. ⁸· The sloping soil of Aesula.'’ This town is supposed to have
stood in the vicinity of Tibur, and from the language of the poet
must have been situate on the slope of a hill—8. Telegoni juya par-
ricidae ‚· alluding to the ridgc of hills on *which [Ru-sculum was situated.
This city is said to have been founded by Ttssl‘efflnus, son of Ulysses and
Circe, who came hither after havingssfftred liis—‘father without lfffowing
