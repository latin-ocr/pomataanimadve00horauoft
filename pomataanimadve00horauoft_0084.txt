Cum Marte confundet Thyoneus
Proelia: nec metues protervum

Suspecta Cyrum, ne male dispari 25
Incontinentes injiciat manus,
Et scindat haerentem coronam
Crinibus, immeritamque vestem.

in the sense of Qsplendidm and to contain a figurative allusion to

Lesbian wine,'' observes Henderson, ‘⁸ would seem to have possessed a deli-
cious flavour, for it is said to have deserved the name of ambrosia rather than
of wine, and to have been like nec-tar when old. (Athenaeus, i. 22.) Horace
terms the Lesbian an innocent or unintoxicating wine ; but it was the pre—
vailing opinion among the ancients, that all sweet wines were less injurious
to the head, and less apt to cause intoxication, than-the strong dry wines.
By Pliny, however, the growths of Chios and Thasos are placed before the
Lesbiam, which, he affirms, had naturally a saltish tastc.''—History of
Ancient and Modern IVines, p. 77.

and occasionally, also, on their cups. Pei-fumes were at the same time
offered to such as chose to anoint their face and hands, or have their garlands
sprinkled with them. This mode of adorning their persons, which was
borrowed from the Asiatic natio obtained so universally among the
Greeks and Romans, that, By almost every author aster the time of Homer,
it is spoken of as the necessary accompaninient of the feast. It is said to
have originated f1om a belief that the leaves of certain plants, a the ivv

power of dispersing the fumes and counteracting the noxious effects of wine.
On this account the ivy has been always held sacred to Bacchus, and formed
the basis of the wreaths with which his images, and the heads of his wor—
sfflppers, were encircled ς but, being deficient in smell, it was seldom
employed for festal garlauds ς and, in general, the preference was given to
the myrtle, which, in addition to its cooling or astringent qualities, was
