Majus parabo, majus infundam tibi
Fastidienti poculum.
Priusque coelum sidet inferius mari,
Tellure porrecta super, 80
Quam non amore sic meo flagres, uti
Bitumen atris ignibus.'’—-
Sub haec puer, jam non, ut ante, mollibus
Lenire verbis impias 3

infinitive in Latin, and the idiom of the Greek, by which the same mood,

tim-85. Unde. “ In what words.'’ The unhappy boy is at a loss in
what words to express his angry and indignant feelings at the hon-id rites
practised by the hags, and at the still more horrid cruelty which they medi-

wrong, but they cannot alter the destiny of mortals.'’ The idea intended
to be conveyed is this: The spells of the sorceress may succeed in
accomplishing the darkest of crimes, but they cannot avert the punish-
ment which such offences will inevitably receive—89. Diris aqam vos.
‘⁴ With my cui-ses will I pursue you.” After diris understand precibus.
