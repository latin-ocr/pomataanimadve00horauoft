XX LIFE AND CHARACTER

Horace, and Varius, and Valgius, and Virgil Ξ Of these distinguished
poets, and of many other literary men, Maecenas waS, during his
whole life, the patron, protector, and friend. Desert in learning
never failed, in course of time, to obtain from him its due reward ;
and his friendship, when once procured, continued steady to the last.
Among the distinguished men Qgrequented the house of Maecenas
a constant harmony seems to have subsisted. They never occasioned
uneasiness to each other ; they were neither jealous 1101· envious of
the favour and felicity which their rivals enjoyed. The noblest and
most affluent of the number were without insolence, and the most
learned without presumption. Merit, in whatever shape it appeared,
occupied an honourable and unmolestcd station ’ἦ

Maecenas is better known to posterity as a patron of Literature
than as an anthol-3 but living in a poetical court, and surrounded
with poem, it was almost impossible that he should have avoided the
contagion of versification. He wrote Qagegy called Octavia, a
poem entitled De Cultu, and some Phalaecian and Galliambic verses.
ΑΗ these have perished, except a few fragments cited by Seneca and
the ancient grammarians. To judge from these extract5‚ their loss
is not much to be regretted 3 and it is a curious problem in the lite-
rary history of Rome, that one who read with delight the works of
Virgil and Horace, should himself have written in a style so obscure
and affected. The effeminacy of his manners appears to have tainted
his language : though his ideas were sometimes happy, his style was
loose, florid, and luxuriant† ς and he always ainied at winding up his
periods with some turn of thought or expression which he considered
elegant or striking. These gonceits were called by Augustus his
perfumed curls (calamistri) 3 and iiiaeone of that emperor’s letters,
which is ΡῖῗΞέιῗῧὲἶῙἿῇἮηογοῦἰυε, he parodies the luxuriant and
sparkling style affected by his minister.

Maecenas continued to govern the state, to patronise good poets,
and write bad verses, for a period of twenty years.. During this long
space of time, the only interruption to his felicity was the conduct of
his wife Terentia. This beautiful but capricious woman was the
sister of Proculeius, so eminent for his fraternal love ἶ, as also of

 

 

Licinius Muraena, who conspired against Augustus. The extrava-
gance and bad temper of this fantastical yet lovely female were
sources of perpetual chagrin and uneasiness to her husband. Though
his existence was embittered by her folly and caprice, he continued
during his whole life to be the dupe of the passion which he enter-
tained for her. He could neither live with nor without her; he
quarrelled with her, and was reconciled almost every day, and put
