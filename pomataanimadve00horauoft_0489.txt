EPISTLES. 447

object of Horace was to expose viee and folly; but in his epistles hc has
also an eye to the amendment of a friend, on whose fnilings he gently
touches, and hints perhaps at their correction.

That infinite variety of Roman character, which was of so much ser-
vice to Horace in the composition of his satires, was also of advantage to
the epistles, by affording opportunitics of light and agreeable compli-
ment, or of gentle rebuke, to those friends to whom they were addressed.
“ The knowledge of these characters‚” says Blackwell, ‘⁶ enables us to
judge with certainty of the capital productions of the Roman genius, and
the conduct of their most admired writers, and thus observe the address
of Horace in adjusting his compliments to the various tempers of his
friends. One was proud of his high descent, but ashamed to own
that he was so 3 another valued himself on the honours and offices he had
borne ; and a third, despising these honours, hugged himself in the ele-
gance of his table, and the plcasures of his private life. A hint to the
first of these, of the nobleness of his blood, would make it flush in his
face ; consulships, and triumphs, and provinces, would be the welcome
subject to the ears of the second; and the vanity of these pageants‚
a smile at a lictor, or a jest on the fasces, would steal a smile from the
last.”

The first book contains twenty epistles of a very miscellaneous nature.
Our poet asks news from Julius Florus, inquires concerning the health
and occupations of Tibellus‚ invites Manlius Torquatus to supper, recom-
mends a friend to Tiberius, and explains himself to Maecenas, with
regard to some want of deference or attention of which his patron had
complained. On such ordinary and even trivial topics, he bestows novelty,
variety, and interest, by the charm of languago and expression. Other
epistles treat of his favourite subject, the happiness and tranquillity of a
country life; and we know that these were actually penned while enjoy-
ing, during the autumn heats, the shady groves and the cool streams of
his Sabine retreat. In a few he rises to the higher tone of moral
instruction, explaining his own philosophy, and inveigfflng, as in the
satires, against the inconsistency of men, and their false desires for
wealth and honours. From his early youth, Horace had collected max-
ims from all the sects of Greece, searching for truth with an eclectic
spirit, alike in the shades of the Academy and the Gardens of Epicurus.
In these philosophie epistles he sometimes rises to the moral grandem
and majesty of Juvenal ς while other lines possess all the shrewdness,
good sense, and brevity of the maxims of Publius Syrus.

The great principle of his moral philosophy is, that happiness depends
on the frame of the mind, and not on the adventitious circumstances of
wealth or power. This is the precept which he endeavours to instil into
Aristius, this is his warning to Bullatius, who sought by roaming to
other lands to heal his distempered spirit. What disposition of mind is
most conducive to tranquillity and happiness, and how these are best to
be obtained, from the constant subject of his moral inquiries. v

The epistles of the first hook are chiefly ethical or familiar. Those of
the second are almost wholly critical. The critical works of Horace
have generally been considered, especially by critics themselves, as the
most valuable part of his productioris Hurd has pronounced them “ the
best and most exquisite of all his writings,” and of the Epistle to the
Paos, in particular, he says, “ that the learned have long since con-
