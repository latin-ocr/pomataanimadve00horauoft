CARMINUM Lm. 11. 2. 39

Latius regnes avidum domando
Spiritum, quam si Libyam remotis 10

Vocibus 3 regnum et diadema tutum

Deferens uni propriamque laurum,

Quisquis ingentes oculo irretorto
Spectat acervos.

The avaricious man is here compared to one who is suffering under a
dmpsy. In either case there is tho same hankering after what only serves
to aggi-«wate the nature of the disease.—-15. Aquosus lanquor. The
dropsy (ὕδρωψ) takes its name from the circumstance of water (ὕδωρ)
being the most visible cause of the distemper, as well as from the pallid
