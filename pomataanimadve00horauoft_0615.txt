EPISTOLARUM Llss. 11. '2- 571

Forte sub hoc tempus castellum evertere praetor

Nescio quod cupiens, hortari coepit eundem 35

Verbis, quae timido quoque possent addere mentem:

I, bone, quo virtus tua te vocat. I pede fausto,

Grandia laturus meritorum praemia .' Quid stas ,9

Post haec ille catus, quantumvis rusticus, Ibit, Ι

Ibit eo qao vis, qui zonam perdidit, inquit. 40
Romae nutriri mihi contigit atque doceri,

Iratus Graiis quantum nocuisset Achilles:

Adjecere bonae paulo plus artis Athenae3

Scilicet ut possem curvo dignoscere rectum,

Atque inter silvas Academi quaerere verum. 45

phalerae, δια-33. Accipit et bis dena super sestertia nummfim. “He
receives, besides, twenty thousand sesterces.'¹'——34. Praetor. “The
general.” The term praetor is here used in its earlier acceptation3
it was originally applied to all who exercised either civil or military
authority. ( Praetor: is qui praeit J ure et erre›*citu.)-—-36. Timido quoque,
“Even to a coward„³’-39. Post haec ille catus, quantumvis rusticus,
inquit. “Upon this, the cunning fellow, a mere rustic though he was,
replied.”—40. zonam. “ His purse.” The girdle or belt served sorne-
times for a purse. More commonly, however, the pnrse hung from the
neck. Horace applies this storf,⁷ to his own case. The soldier fought
bravely, as long as necessity drove him to the step 3 when, however, he
made good his losse& he concemed himself no more about venturing
on desperate enterprises. So the poet, while his means were contracted,
wrote verses for a support 3 now, however, that he has obtained a oom-
petency, the inclination for verses has departed.

41—45. 41. Romae nutriri mihi contigit. Horace came to Rome
with his father, at the age of nine or ten years, and was placed under
the instruction of Orbilius Pupillus-42. Iratus Graiis quantum no-
cuisset Achilles. The poet alludes to the Iliad of Homer, which he
read at school with his preceptor, and with which the Roman youth
began their studies—43. Bonae Athenae. “Kind Athens.” The epithet
here applied to this celebrated city is peculiarly pleasing. The poet
speaks of it in the language of fond and grateful recollection, for the
benefits which he there received in the more elevated departments of
inanimem—Artis. Τὴε term ars is here used in the sense of doctrina,
“learning,” and the reference is to the philosophical studies pursued
by Horace in the capital of Attica-44. Scilicet ut possem curvo dig-
noscere rectum. “That Ι might be able, namely, to distinguish a straight
line from a curve.'' The poet evidently alludes to the geometrioel studies,
which were deemed absolutely necessary by the followers of the Am-
demy to the understanding of the sublime doctrines that were taught
within its precincts.—45. Siluas Academi ‚- alluding to the school of
Plato. The place which the philosopher made choice of for this pur-
pose was a public grove, called Academus, which received its appella-
tion‚ according to some, from Hecademus, who lest it to the citizens
for the purpose of gymnastic exercises. Adorned with statues, tem-
