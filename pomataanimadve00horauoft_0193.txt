CARMINUM LIB. 111. 10. 153

Projectum ante fores objicere incolis
Plorares Aquilonibus.

Audis quo strepitu janna, quo nemus 5
Inter pulchra satum tecta remugiat 2
Sentis el: positas ut glaciet nives

Puro numine Jupiter ἓ

Ingratum Veneri pone superbiam,
N e currente rota. funis eat retro. 10
Non te Penelopen difficilem procis

Tyrrhenus genuit parens.

O, quamvis neque te munera, nec preces,

Neo tinctus viola pallor amantium,

Neo vir Pieria pellice saucius 15
Currat: supplicibus tuis

alluding to his inconstant and fickle d-isposition.—Improbo. “ Stormy.’'
—24. Tecum vivere amem, &a “ Yet with thee Ι shall love to live,
with thee I shall cheerfnlly die.'’ Supply tamen, as required by quam-
quam, which precedes.

Onr. X.-—A specimen of the songs called παρακλαυσίθυρα by the Greeks,

the far-distant Tanais 3 '' ἰ. e. wert thou a native of the Scythian wilde-⁴—
2. Saevo nupta viro. “ Wedded to a barbarian husband.'’—3. Incolis.
“ Which have made that land the place of their abode.” The poet means
by the expressive term incolis to designate the northern blast as con-
tinually raging in the wilds of Scythia—4. plorares. “ Thou wouldst
regret.”—-5. Nemus inter pulchra, &c.; referring to the trees planted
within the inclosure of 'the impluvium. This was a court-yard, or open
space, in the middle of a Roman house, generally without any covering at
the top, and surrounded on all sides by buildings: trees were frequently
planted here, and more particularly the laurel.—-7. Sentis et positas, &c.
‘⁶ And thou perceivest how Jove, by his pure influence‚ hardens the fallen
snows;’' i. e. and thou perceivest how the clear, dry air hardens the

revolving, the rope on a sudden ῆς back ;'’ an allusion to some mechanica}
coutrivanoe for raising heavy weights, and which consists of a wheel with a
rope passing in a groove along its outer edge. Should the weight of the
mass that is to be raised prove too heavy‚ the rope, unable to resist‚ snaps
munder and flies back, being drawn down by the body intended to be
elevated. The application of this image to Lyce is pleasing and natural:
“ Be not too haughty and disdainful‚ lest tnou fall on a sudden from thv
present state, lest thou be abandoned by those who are now eron-<ling
arouud, a herd of willing slaves.”-l2. Tyrrhenus parens. The morals
