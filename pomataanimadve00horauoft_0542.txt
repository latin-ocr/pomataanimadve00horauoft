500 Q. HoRATn FLACCI

Dum 11061, ac vultum servat Fortuna benignum, 20
Romae laudetur Samos et Chios et Rhodos absens.

Tu, quamcunque deus tibi fortunaverit horam,

Grata 5111116 mann, neu dulcia differ in annum 3

Ut, quocunque loco fueris, vixisse libenter
Te dicas. Nam si ratio et prudentia curas, ⁴ 25

Non locus effusi late maris arbiter, aufert :

Goelum, non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt.
Strenua nos exercet inertia; navibus atque

Quadrigis petimus bene vivere. Quod petis, hic est,

Est Ulubris, animus si te non deficit aequus. 30

which they ought to avoid. So here, all these pursuits of happiness are
mere idleness‚ oand turn to no account. W e a1e at incredible pains in

Ulubrzs. Ulubrae was a small town of Latium, and appears to have
stood in a plain at no great distance from Velitrae. Its marshy situ-
ation is plainly alluded to by Cicero, (Ep. ad. Fam. vii. 18.) who calls
the inhabitants little froys. Juvenal also gives us but a wretched idea

The epistle concludes with recommending Pompeius Grosphus, and
with a short account of the most important news at Roma—The indi-
