EPODON LIBER. 17. 269

Effare : jussas cum fide poenas luam 3

Paratus, expiare seu poposceris

Centum juvencis, sive mendaci lyra.

Voles sonare tu pudica, tu proba ; 40
Perambulabis astra sidus aureum.

Infamis Helenae Castor offensus vice,

Fraterque magni Castoris, victi prece,

Ademta vati reddidere Iumina.

Et tu, potes nam, solve me dementia, 45
O nec paternis obsoleta sordibus,

N ec in sepulcris pauperum prudeus anus
Novendiales dissipare pulveres.

Tibi hospitale pectus, ct purae manus:

Tuusque venter Pactumeius 5 et tuo 50

ment.”.-39. Centum juvencis. “ With a hecatomb of bullon-ks?—
Mendaci lyra. ‘⁶ On tho lying lyre ;'' i. e. 011 the lyre which will cclc-
brate thee, a shameless woman, as the ornament of thy sex.—4l. Per-
ambulabis astra sidus aureum. “ Thou shalt proudly move, a brilliant
constellation amid the stars ;'' i. e. my verses will raise thee to the stars ‹rf
heaven. Tho verb perambulo carries with it the idea of a proud and boast—

ful demeanour.

42—50. 42. Infamis Helenae Castor, διο. “ Castor, osl'endcd at
the treatment of the defamed Helen.’' ἃς. ; an allusion to the story re-
lated of the poet Stesichorus. Having defamed Helen in some injurious
verses, he was punished with blindness by her brothers, Castor and
Pollux. On the bard's publishing a recantation, they restored him to
sight.—45. Potes nam. Equivalent to the Greek δύνασαι γάρ, and a
usual form of expression in prayers and addresses to the gods.—46. O nec
patentis, &c. “ Ο thou that art disgraced by no paternal stains.'' There.
is a great deal of bitter satire in this negative mode of alluding to the pre-
tended fairness of Canidia’s birth.—47. Nec in sepulcris pauperum, &c-
“ And art not skillam as a sorceress, in scattering the ninth-day ashes
amid tho tombs of the poor ;'' i. e. and knowest not what it is to go as a
sorceress amid the tombs of the poor, and scatter their ashes on the ninth
day after intermeat. The ashes of the dead were frequently used in magio
rites, and the rules of the art required, that they must be taken from the
tomb ou the ninth day after intermeat (not, as some without any authority
pretend, on the ninth day after death). The sepulchres of tho rich were
protected against this profanation by wmches, (compare Dorville‚ ad Charit.
p. 429. ed. Lips.) and the sorceresses were, therefore, compelled to have
recourse to the tombs of the pom—49. Hospitale pectus. “ A compas-
sionate bosom.’'—Purae. ‘⁴ Unstained with guilt ; ’' i. e. thou stealest
no boys whom thou mayest kill with lingering hunger. Compare Epode 5.

tumeius, too, was actually given by thee to the world ; '’ i. e. and Pactu-
