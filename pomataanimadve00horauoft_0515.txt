I-IPISTOLARUM Lm. 1. 5. 473

Parcus ob heredis curam nimiumque severus

Assidet insano. Potare et spargere flores

Incipiam, patiarque vel inconsultus haberi. 15
Quid non ebrietas designat? operta recludit,

Spes jubet csse ratas, in proelia trudit inertem,

Sollicitis animis onus eximit, addocet artes.

F ecundi calices quem non fecere disertum ἲ

Contracta quem non in paupertate solutum? 20

Haec ego procurare et idoneus imperor, et non

Invitus 3 ne turpe toral, ne sordida mappa

Corruget nares; ne non et cantharus et lanx

Ostendat tibi te3 ne fidos inter amicos

Sit, qui dicta foras eliminet 3 ut co‘e'at par 25

and the passage may be rendered as follows: ‘· If it is not permitted me
to enjoy an opportunity for festive indulgence, of what advantage is it to
me when it comes s-·’-13. Parcus ol» heredis curam, διο. “ He that
lives sparingly, and pinchcs himself too much, out of regard to his heir,
is next—door neighbour to a madman ;” literally, ⁸· sits by the side of the
madman.'' The use of assidet is here extremely elegant. Compare the
opposite expression, “Dissidere ab insatw.''—l5. Patiarque vel incon-
sultus haberi. “And I will be content to be regarded even as incon-
siderate and foolish.¹’ We have no single epithct that appears to con-
vey the full force of inconsultus in this passage—16. Quid non ebrietas
designat? “ What does not wine effect ἴθ’ 01, more freely, “to what
length does not wine proceed 1-”—18. Adducet artes. Many of the
commentators strangcly err in making this expression mean, that wine
has power to teach the arts! The poet intends merely to comjey the
idea, that wine warrns and animates the breast for the accomplishment of
its plans. Hence the clause may be rendered, ··teaches new means for
the accomph'shment of what we desire? 'l'he force of the preposition in
addocet must be carefully marked—19. Fccamli calices quem non fecere
disertum 2 “VVhom have not the soul-inspiring cups made eloquent ?''
The epithet fecundi, as here employed, is made by some to signify
“full‚” or “ overflowing‚” but with much less propriety. It is precisely
equivalent to animum fecundum reddentes—20. Solutum. Understand
cures. -

21—31. 21. Haec ego procurare et idoneus imperor, διο. “Ι, who
am both the proper person, and not unwilling, am charged to take care
of the following particulars ;'’ i. e. the task that baet suits me, and
which Ι willingly undestake, is as follows—23¹2. N'e turpe toral. “That
no dirty covering on the coucli.'‘—Ne sordida mappa. “No foul nap-
kin.''-23. Corruyet nares. “ May wrinkle the nose ;” i. e. may give
offence to any of the gucsts. According to Quintilian, Horace was the
first that used tho xerb connum—Ne non et cantharus et Ianoe, δίο.
“ That both the bowl and the dish may show thee to thyself ;'’ i. e. may
be so bright and clean, that thou maycst sce thyself in them. As regards
the cantharus, consult note on Ode 1. xx. 2.-25, Etiminet ; elegantly
