‘270 Q. HORATII OELAccl

Cruore rubros obstetrix pannos lavit,
Utcunque fortis exsilis puerpera.

CANIDIA.

Quid obseratis auribus fundis preces?

Non saxa nudis surdiora navitis

Neptunus alto tundit hibernus salo. 55
Inultus ut tu riseris Cotyttia

Vulgata, sacrum liberi Cupidinis ’.ἒ

Et Esquilini Pontifex venefici

Impune ut Urbem nomine impleris meo?

Quid proderat ditasse Pelignas anus 60
Velociusve miscuisse toxicum?

Sed tardiora fata te votis manent ε

Ingrata misero vita ducenda est, in hoc,

Novis ut usque suppetas laboribus.

with swelling surge. rocks more deas to the cry of the naked max-iners
than Ι am to thine.”—56. Inultus ut tu riseris, διο. “ For thee to

over the incantations and secret rites which we perform on the Esqui-
line hill amid the graves of the poor. Compare note on verse 47 of this
Epode, and on Ode 111. xxix. 10.-60. Quid proderat ditasse, ἃς.
“ Of what advantage was it to me, to have enriched Pelignian someoesses,
or to have mixed a speedier potion? '³ i. e. what have Ι gained by having
paid Pelignian sorceresses an extravagant sum for instructions in the
magio art, or by having learned to mix a more potent draught of’love?
—The Peligni were situated to the east of the Marsi, and, like them,
were famed for their magic skill. Consult note on Ode 111. xix, 8.—62.

Sed tardiora fata, Sec. ‘⁶ But a more lingering destiny than what thy .

prayers shall demand awaits thee. A painful existence is to be pro-
longed to thee, a miserable being, with this sole view, that thou mayest
continually survive for fresh inflictione of torturesss The idea intended
to be conveyed is as follows: Thy entreaties for a cessation from suf-
ferings are fruitless, I will increase and prolong those sufferings to
such a degree, that thou shalt pray to be released from them by a
zpeedy death. T hat prayer, however, shall not be heard3 and thou
