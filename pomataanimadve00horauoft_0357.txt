Ignoscas, vitiis teneor. Fortassis ct istinc

Largiter abstulerit longa aetas, liber amicus,

Consilium proprium ; neque enim, quum lectulus aut me
Porticus excepit, desum mihi. Rectius hoc est ,·

Hoc faciens vivam melius ,· sic dulcis amicis 135
Occurram ,· hoc qnidam non belle ; numquid eqo illi
Imprudens olim faciam simile ξ’ Haec ego mecum
Compressis agito labris ; ubi quid datur oti,

Illudo chartis. Hoc est mediocribus illis

Ex vit-iis unum, cui si concedere nolis, 140
Multa. poetarum veniet manus, auxilio quae

Sit mihi, nam multo plures sumus, ac veluti te

<Iudaei cogemus in hanc concedere turbam.

better revenge against the enemies of poetry, than to force them ιι»

the courts ofjustice, disturbed the judge8‚ aud were always more successful
in proportion as they were more impudent. Such is the character given

Sume V.-This little poem contains the account of ajourney from
Rome to Brundisium, which Horace performed in company with Maece-
nas, virgil, Plotius, and Varius. Though travelling on affairs of state,
their progress more resembled an excursion of pleasurc, than a journey
requiring the despatch of plenipotentinn'es. They took their own villas
