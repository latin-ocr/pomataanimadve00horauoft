ψὰρ. “ Τοο faithless to bear in vonnnon with us the yoke of adver-
sity.'' Compare Serm. 1. iv, 12. ‘⁶ Piyer ferre‚’' i. e. “nimis piyer
quam ut ferat.”—29. Ultimos orbis Britannos. In designating the
Britons as “ ultimos orbis‚'¹ Horace must be understood to speak more as
a poet than ffigeogrnfflwr, since the Romans of his day were well acqua imssd
with the existence ofssiibQia. It must be acknowledged, however, that
it was no uncommon thing to call ΜΨ islanjls in this quarter by the
general name of gnsulag Bristmnioaesffib'e‘rabmaz νῆσοι). Compare
Pliny‚ H ist. N at. iv. 6. :1an Miisfiffissffbbyoss. (Ιῖφῖ Grieclzen und Rb‘mer,
vol. ii. pt. 2. p. 33. seqq. Qgt-uflns also (xi. 11) applies the epithet
ultimos to the Blitons, but at a. meffli·iir›r period.

Greeks, while as yet they knew little of Ιηι-ἱίἐΖ-ᾑζῐρῳθλιὶᾼρρλασσαθ (Mare
Erythraeum.) and the name was said {o he derived from that of an an-
cien monarci² Efflffl who reigned at a. very early period on these
shores. Subscquen ly, however, the term was restricted to the sea below
Arabia and between the Arabiam and Persian Gulf. The Latin appella-
tion, Oceanus cher, answers in the present instance to the Ἐρυθρὰ
θάλασσα in its ore extensive meaning, and is evidently a tran51ation os
the name on the su osition that it refers to colour. It is more than
probable that this supposition is the true one, and that no monarch of the
name of Erythras ever existed. A collate-rai argument in favour of this
may be drawn from the modern designation of the Sinus Arabicus (Rea
Sea). The meaning of this modern name must be looked for in that of

“Idumea or the land of Edom, whose coasts the Sinus Arabicus touches on
the north. Edom² in the Hebrew tongue, si nifies red. and was the name
given to Esau for selling his birthright {or amess o? red pottage.÷33.
Eheu! cicatricum, διο. “ Ah! Ι am ashamed of ‹MT-{nd our Β
gunt, aud ofbr0t11e1·s—--” The poet was going to add, ‘⁴ slain by the
hand of br0t11e1s ς ” but the thought was too horrid for utterance, and the
sentence is therefore abruptly broken off. (Consult Various Readinys.)
He merely adds in general language‚ “ What in fine have we, a. hardened
age, avoided ? '⁹ &a The reference throughout the stanza is to the bloody
struggle of the civil wars.
