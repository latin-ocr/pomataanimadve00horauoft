peasants, fantastically disguised in masks cut out from the hark ot
trees, danced or sung to a certain kind of verse, which they called
Saturnian. Such festivals had usually the double purpose cf worship
and recreation ; and accordingly the verses often ‹ligrcssed from the
praises of Bacchus to mutual taunts and railleries, like those in Virgil's
third eclogue, on the various defecta and vices of the speakers, ‘⁶ Ver-
sibus alternis opprobria rustica sudu? Such verses, originally sung or re-
cited in the Tuscan and Latin villages at nuptials or religious festivals,
were first introduced at Rome by Histriam, who were summoned from
Etruria to Rome in order to allay a pestilence which was depopulating
the city. (Liv. vii. 2.) These Histrions‚ being mounted on a stage, like
our mountebanks, perfomied a sort of ballet, by dancing and gesticu-
lating to the sound of musical instrumenta. The Roman youths thus
learned to imitate their gestures and music, which they accompanied
with railing verses delivered in extemporary dialogue. Such verses
were tex-med Fescennine, either because they were invented at F escetznia,
a city of Etruria ; or from Fascinus, one of the Roman deities. The
jeering, however, which had been at first confined to inoffensive
raillery‚ at length exceeded the bounds of moderatiori, and the peace of
private families was invaded by the unrestrained license of persona]
invective. This exposure of private individuals, which alal-med even
those who had been spared, was restrained by a salutary law of the
Decemviri—147. Recurrentes accepta per annos. “ Received through
returning years ;'' ι’. αὶιαῐιᾱεᾰ down with each returning year.——l48.
Donec jam saevus apertam, διο. “ Until now bitter jests began to be
converted into open and virulent ahuse.”—-15l. Fuit intactis quoque
cura, &c. “ They too that were as yet unassailed felt a solicitude for
the common condition of all.”——l53. 11!an quae nollet carmine quem-
quam describi. “ Which forbade any one being stigmatized in defama-
tory strains.’'--l54. Vertere modum. Supply poema—Formidine fustis.
The punishment ordained by the law already referred to, against any
one who should violate its provisions, was to be beaten to death with
clubs. It was termed fustuarium, and formed also a part of the military
discipline in the case of deserters.
