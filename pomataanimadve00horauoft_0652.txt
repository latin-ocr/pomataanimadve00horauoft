itself worthy a god's unravelling.'’ As regards the peculiar force of
the term vindex, compare the remark of Gesner: “Vindex est, 'qui
summo in periculo versantem subito liberat et eripit.” Horace intends¹
this precept as a censure upon a common fault among the ancient
Tragic poets, that of having recourse to some deity for the unravelling
of the plot, whenever they were at a loss in relation to it. He was
made to descend in a species of machine 3 whence the expression, deus
er machina—492. Nec quarta loqui persona laboret. Horace here en»
joins on the Roman dramatist the practice so strictly observed'among
the Greeks, of confining the number of netors to three. In the origin
of the drama the members of the chorus were the only performers.
Thespis was his own actor, or, in other words, he first introduced
an actor distinct from the chorus. sEschylus added a second, and
Sophocles a third ; and this continued to be ever after the legitimate
number. Hence, when three characters happened to be already on
the stage, and a fourth was to come on, one of the three was obliged to
retire‚ change his dress, and so return as the fourth personage. The
poet, however, might introduce any number of mutes, as guar-ds, attend-
ants, See.

‘⁶ Let the chorus supply the place of a performer, and sustffl'n an active
part in thc 1·epresentation.'' According to the rules of the ancient
drama, the chorus wasto be considered as one of the actors, and its
coryphaeus, or head, spoke for the whole number composing it. As
regards the expression officium virile, compare the explanatory com-
ment of Hurd: ‘⁶ Officium virile means a strenuous, diligent office,
such as becomes a person interested in the progress of the action. 'The
precept is levelled against the practice of those poets, who, though they
allot the part of a persona dramatis to the chorus, yet for the most part
make it so idle 'and insignificant a one, as is of little consequence in
the rep1·esentation.'’—l94. Nea quid medios intercinat actus, διο. “ Nox·
let it sing any thing between the acts that dces not in some way con-
duee t0‚ and connect itself aptly with, the plot.’' How necessary this
nnght be to the writers of the Augustali age, remarks Hurd, cannot
certainly appear: but if the practice of Seneca may give room for any
suspicion, it should seem to have been much wanted3 in whom 1
scarcely believe there is a single instance of the chorus being employed
in a manner consonant to its true end and character—126. Ille bonis
faveatque et consilietur amice. ⁴⁶ Lct it both take the side of the good,
and give them friendly advice.'’——l97. Et amec pacare tumentes. The
common text has peccare timentes.—198. Mensae brevis. “ Of a frugal
mble.” Compare Epist. 1. xiv. 35. “Coena brevis.'’—199.· Et apertis
