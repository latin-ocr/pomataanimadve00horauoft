The term Epode (Ἐπῳδός) was used in more than one signification. lt
was applied, in the first place, to an assemblage of lyric verses immediately
succeeding the strophe and antistrophe, and intended to close the period or
strain. Hence the name itself from ἐπί and 93δὴ denoting something sun-9
after another piece. In the next place, the appellation was given to a
small lyric poem, composed of several disfichs, in each of which the first
verse was an iambic trimeter, (six feet,) and the last a dimeter· (four feet).
Of this kind were the Epodes of Archilochus, mentioned by Plutarch, in
his Dialoyue on Music ,· (28. vol· xiv. p. 234. ed. Hutten ς’) and under
[his same class are to be ranked a majority of the Epodes of Horace.
Lastly, the term Epode was so far extended in signification, as to designate
any poem in which α shorter verse was made to follow a long] one ;
which will serve as a general definition for all the productions of Horace
that go by this name. Compare, in relation to this last meaning of the
word, the language of Hephaestion, (de Metr. p. 70. ed. Pauw‚) Εἰσὶ δ’ ἐν
τοῖς ποιήμασι καὶ οἱ ἆρῤενικῶς οὕτω καλούμενοι ἐπῳδαὶ, ὅταν μεγάλῳ
στίχῳ περιττόν τι ἐπιφέρηται· where περιττόν corresponds to the
Latin impar, and refers to a verse unequal to one which has gone before,
or, in other words, less than it. ὓ

Epona I.-—-Written a short time previous to the battle of Actium. The
hard offers himself as a companion to Maecenas, when the latter was on the
eve of embarking iu the expedition against Antony and Cleopatra, and
expresses his perfect willingness to share every danger with his patron and
friend. Maecenas, however, apprehensive for the poet’s safety, refused to
grant his request.
