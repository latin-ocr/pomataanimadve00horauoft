SERMONUM LIB. 11. 8. 445

Et leporum amisos, ut multo suavius, armos,

Quam si cum lumbis quis edit. Tum pectore adusto 90
Vidimus et merulas poni, et sine clune palumbes ;

Suaves res, si non causas narraret earum ct

N aturas dominus, quem nos sic fugimus ulti,

Ut nihil omnino gustaremus, velut illis

Canidia afflasset pejor serpentibus Afris. 95

Romans, as they still are by modern, epicures, a great delicacy, and these
birds were purposely futtened on various kinds of food, among the rest
on figs, with the view of incrcasing the size of their livera—89. Leporum
armos. Nasidienus should have kept these away from his guests, and
have served up the other parts that are ironically condemned in the text.
-90, Edit. The old form of the subjunctive, from edim. Compare
Epode iii. 3.——A1lnslo. ‘⁶ Burnt.”—9l . Alerulas. “ BlackbirdS.''—Sine
clune palumbes. Our host, observes Francis, had probably bought these
birds at a eheap price, since the rumPS, which are the most delicious
part, were so tainted as not to bc brought on table—92. Suaves res.
hemeah—Causas et naturas. “Their causes and natures ;” i. e. the
causes, by reason of which a particular part was sometimes to be pre-
ferred to all the rest of the body, and one part to another, as well as the
peculiar matures of these several parts. In other words, their talkative
host became more insupportable than the entertainment itself, and they
were glad to escape from him—94. Velut illis Canidia afflasset, ἃς.
“ Asif Canidia,more venomous than African serpents, had poisoned them

with her breath.“' With afflasset supply venenum.
