ΤΒΕ object- of the present XVork isto furnish the student with a text-
book ‘of convenient sizo, and which may contain, at the same time, a
commentary sufficiently ample for all his wants. The larger edition
of Horace, which appeared in the spring of 1830, has supplied all the
requisite materials, and such selections have been made from it as
seemed best calculated to answer the proposed end. It will be per—
eeived, upon examination, that a large portion of the preliminary
matter has been thrown out from the present edition. This, however
interesting to the inore advaneed scholar, could hardly be deemed of
immediate iinportance to the young student, on his first acquaintance
with the Venusian hard. 'l‘he “ Excursions‚'' also, that were inserted
in various parts of the larger Work, have been rejected from this,
on similar grounds, and their places have been supplied by notes of a
concise form, wherever these were needed. The most marked omis-
sion, however, is in the case of the critical notes on the Various
ReadingS. Their insertion in the larger edition was a mere matter
of experiment, and, unfortunate-ly for the cause of classical scholarship
in our country, the experiment proved an unsuccessful one. Various
Readings, and critical notes of any kind, are objects of peculiar aver-
sion to a certain class of scholare among us, nor ean they see any-
thing inviting in those fields of exertion which have yielded so rich a
harvest of praise to the learned of other elimes. It is idle to talk of
conjectural emendations¹ when those'whom you address are satisfiet}
with any text, however erroneous ; and philological discussions corne
recommended by no eharm, to minds that regard every deviation
from the beaten track as leading into the wilds of unprofitable theory.
The absence of critical notes, therefore, from the present edition,
will, it is hoped, be pardoned by the enlightened scholar, should this
WVork ever enjoy the good fortune‚·which was denied its less favoured
predecessor, of being brought to the bar of learned and intelligent
criticism.

If, however, the critical notes have been excluded from the present
edition, care has been taken to retain whatever related to points of a
metrical nature. An acquaintance with the rhythxn and cadenee of
the Odes is indispensably requisite in the student ; and a neglect of
this is always a sure proof of incapacity or wilful carelessness on the
