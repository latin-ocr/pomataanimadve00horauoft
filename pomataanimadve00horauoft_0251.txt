CARMINUM LIB. IV. 8. 211

CARMEN VIII.
AD CENSORINUM.

DONAREM pateras grataque commodus,
Censorino, meis aera sodalibus ;

Dona-rem tripodas, praemia fortium

Graiorum ; neque tu pessima munerum

Ferres, divite me scilicet artium, 5
Quas aut Parrhasius protulit, aut Scopas,

Hic saxo, liquidis ille coloribus

Sollers nuuc hominem ponere, nunc deum.

Sed non haec mihi vis : nee tibi talium

Res est aut animus deliciarum egens. 10

Ona VIII.—Supposed to have been written at the time of tho Satur-
nalia3 at which period of the year, as well as on other stated festivals, it
was customary among the Romans for friends to send presents to ono
another. The ode before us constitutos the poet's gift to Censorinus; and,
in order to enhance its value, he dcscants on the. praises of his favour-ito
art. There were two distinguished individuals at Rome of the name of
Censorinus, the father and son. The latter, C. Marcius Censorinus, is
most probably thc- onc who is here- addressed, as, in point of years, he was
the more fit of the two to be the eompanion of Horace, and as Velleius
Paterculus (ii. 102) stylos him, virum dcmerendis hominibus yenitum.
He was consul along with C. Asinius Gallus, A. U. C. 746.

l—ll. l. Donarem pateras, &e. “ Liberal to my friends, Censo-
rinus, I would bestow upon them cups and pleasing vessels of bronze3 ’⁹
ἰ. e. I would libemlly bestow on my friends cups and vessels of beauteous
bronze. The poet alludes to the taste for collecting antiques, which then
poevailed among his coilntrymen.--3. Tripodas. The ancients made
very frequent use of the tripod for domestic purposes‚ to set their lamps
upon, and also in religious ceremonies. Perhaps the most frequent appli-
eation of all others was to serve water out in their common habitatious.
In these instances, the uppcr part was sodisposcd as to receive a vase.—
4. Neque tu pessima munerum ferres. “ Nor shouldst thou bear
away as thine own the meanest of gifts ;’“ a litotes for tu optima et
rarissima manera serres.—5. Divite me scilicet artium, διο. “ Wero
Ῑ rich in the works of art, which either a. Parrhasius or a Scopas produced 3
the latter in marble, the former bytho aid of liquid coloure, skilsul in
representing at one time a human being, at another a god.''—8. Sollers
ponere ‚- a Graecism for sollers in ponendo, or sollers ponendi. The
artists here mentioned are taken by the poet as the respective represen-
tatives of painting and statuamus—9. Sed non haec mihi vis, &c- “ But
1 possess no store of these things, nor hast thou a fortune or inclination
that needs such euriosities.” In other words : 1 am too poor to own such
valuables; while thou art too rich, and hast too many of them, to need
