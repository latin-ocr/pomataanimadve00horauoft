EPISTOLA An 1²1sosns. 627

Liber et inqenuus, praesertim cemus equestrem

Summam nummorum, vitioque remotas ab omni.—

Tu nihil invita dices faciesve Minerva ; 385

Id tibi judicium est, ea mens: si quid tamen olim

Scripseris‚ in Maeci descendat judicis aures,

Et patris, et nostras, nonumque prematur in annum,

Membranis intus positis. Delere licebit,

Quod non edideris: nescit vox missa reverti. 390
Silvestres homines sacer interpresque deorum

caedibus et victu foedo deterruit Orpheus ;

Dictus ob hoc lenire tigres rabidosque leones :

Dictus et Amphion, Thebanae conditor urbis,

Saxa movere sono testudinis, ct prece blanda 395

—382 Qui nescit, versus tamen audet fingere. “He who knows not
how, yet dares to compose verses ’'—Quidni? Liber et inyenuus, &c

“And why not, pray? He 1s free, and of a good family· ‚ above all, he
is rated at an equestrian fortune, and is far removed from every vice.’
Horace is thought, as Sanadon remarks, to have had in view some par-
ticular might, who fancied he could write verses because he was well-
born and rich. —383. Census equestrem summam nummorum. The sor-
tune necessary to become an eques was four hundred sestertia, or about
three thousand two hundred and twenty· nine pounds sterling. Summam
is here put in the accusative by a Graecism, secundum or quod ad being
understood.

385-390. 385. Invita Minerva. “In opposition to the natural
bent of thy genius. '³ A proverbial form of expression. The mind can
accomplish nothing, unless Minerva, the goddess of mind, lend her
favouring aid. -386. Olim. “.Ever' ’—387. Maec5. The allusion is
to Spurius Maecius (or Metius) Tarpa, a celebrated critic at Rome, iu
the days of Augustus, who was accustomed to sitin judgment on the
dramatic productions that were offered for the stage. Consult note on
Sat. r. x. 38.-388. Nonumque prematur in annum. This precept, ob-
serves Colman, which, like many others in the present epistle, is rather
retailed than invented by Horace, has been thought by some critics
rather extravagant3 but it acquires in this place, as addressed to the
elder Piso, a concealed archness, very agreeable to the poet’s style and
manner. ——389. Intus3 equivalent to in scrinia—390. Nescit vox missa
reverti. Compare Ep3st. 1. xviii. 71. “ {asemel- emissum evolatrz‘rrevo-
cqbiLe verbum?

Sacer interpresque deorum. “'l'he priest and the interpreter of the
gods! ’-392. Vietu foedo. The early race of men are sabled to have
lived on acorns, roms, Sec. -393. Dictus ob hoc lenire tigres διο. Horace
here gives the generally received explanation of the fable of Orpheus.
The wild animals, διο. whom he ιε said to have swayed by the music of
his lyre, were savage men. —394. Dictus et Amphion, &c. Consult
