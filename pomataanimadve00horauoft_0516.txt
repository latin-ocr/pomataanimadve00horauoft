474 Q. HORATII FLAccr

Jungaturque pari. Butram tibi Septiciumque,

Et nisi coena prior potiorque puella Sabinum

Detinet, assumam. Locus est et pluribus umbris3

Tu, quotus esse velis, rescribe,· et rebus omissis 30
Atria servantem postico falle clientem.

Numicius, that human happiness springs from the mind, when the latter
is accustomed to view every thing with a cool and dispassionate eye, and,
