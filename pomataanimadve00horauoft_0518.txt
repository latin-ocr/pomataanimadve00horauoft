776 Q. HORATH FLACCI

I nunc, argentum et marmor vetus aeraque et artes
Suspice, cum gemmis Tyrios mirare colores,

Gaude quod spectant oculi te mille loquentem,

Gnavus mane forum, et vespertinus pete tectum, 20
Ne plus frumenti dotalibus emetat agris

Mutus, et (indignum, quod sit pejoribus ortus)
Hic tibi sit potius, quam tu mirabilis illi.
Quidquid sub terra est, in apricum proferet aeta-s,
Defodiet condetque nitentia. Quum bene notum
Porticus Agrippae et via te conspexerit Appi,

virtue can never consist in excess of any kind—17. I nunc, argentum
et marmor vetas, Sec. Ironical. The connexion in the train of ideas
appears to he as follows ; If we ought to fix our minds too intently upon
nothing, and if even virtue itsclf forms no exception to this rule, but may
become blamable, like other things, when carried to excess, how little
should our attention be turned to the acquisition of riches‚ of popular
favour, and of other objects equally fleeting and transitory? Go, now,
and seek these riches, strive to become conspicuous before the eyes of
all for the splendours ofaffluence3 present thyself as a candidate for
public honours, and fix upon thee the gaze of admiring thousands, while
thou art haranguing them from the rostra3 and when all this is done,
and the object of thy wishes is attained‚ then sink into the grave, that
leveller of all distinctions, and be f01·g0tten.-Aryentum. ‘⁶ Vases of
silver.'’ Understand filetum—Marmor vetus. “ Ancient statues.'’—-
Aera. ‘⁵ Bronze vesselst—Artes. ‘⁶ XVorks of art.”—18. Suspice.
Compare the scholiast: ‘⁶ Cum admiratione adspice.”—-l Ο. Loquentem.
“While harangning in public.”—·29. Gnavus mane forum, διο. The
allusion here is either to the pleading of causes and the gain as well as
popularity resulting therefrom, or else, and what appears more probable,
‘to the money-matters transacted in the forum, the laying out money
at interest, the collecting it in, δια-21. Dotalibus. ‘⁶ Gained by mar-
riage ;” i. e. forming a part or the whole of a wife's dowry.-—22. Mutus.
Some individual is here meant of ignoble birth, but enriched bymarriage.
—Indiynwm quod sit pejoribus ortus. ‘⁶ What would be shameful indeed,
since he is sprung from meaner parents.”—-]‡[irabilis ,· equivalent to
invidendas.

24-27. 24. Quidquid sub terra est, &c. We have here the apodo—
sis of the sentence which began at the l7th verse: It is continued on
to the end of the '27th verse. The idea intended to be conveyed is,
that as whatever is concealed in the bosom of the earth will one day or
other see the light⁷ so whatever now shines above the surface of the
ground will one day or other descend into it. Though thou art now con-
spicuous for wealth and public honours, yet sooner or later shalt thou go
to that abiding-place, whither Numa and Ancus have gone before—25.
Quum; equivalent to quamvis.-Bene notum. Compare the explana-
tion of Do'ring ε “ Et honoribus et maynz'ficentia nobilem.”—26. Porticus
Agrippae. The portico here alluded to was in the vieinity of the Pan-
