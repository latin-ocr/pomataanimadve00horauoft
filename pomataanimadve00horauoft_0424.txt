Novi,
Et miror morbi purgatum te illius.
DAMAsn’Pus.

Emovit veterem mire novus, ut solet, in cor
Trajecto lateris miseri capitisque dolore,
Ut lethargicus hic, quum fit pugil, et medicum urguet. 30

HonArms.
Dum ne quid simile huic, esto ut libet.

DAMASIPPUS.

O bone, ne te
Frustrere 3 insanis et tu stultique prope omnes,
Si quid Stertinius veri crepat 3 unde ego mira
Descripsi docilis praecepta haec, tempore quo me
Solatus jussit sapientem pascere barbam, 35
Atque a Fabricio non tristem ponte reverti.

27—36. 27. Morbi puryatum illius. The genitive is here used by
a Graecism, καθαρθέντα τῆς νόσου. Horace alludes to the antiquarian
mania under which Damasippus had laboured.-A tquz'. “ Why.”—-28.
Ut solet, in cor trajecto, ἃς. “ As is wont to happen, when the pain of
the afflicted side or head passes into the stomaeh.” Cor is often used
by the Latin writers, in imitation of the Greek καρδία, to signify the
stomach. Damasippus wishes to convey the idea, that his antiquarian
fit was converted into a philosophical one, just as pleurisy sometimes

the fienzied patient just spoken of, or, what is far more spirited, to
the poet himselfi—32. Stultique prope omnes,· i. e. et prope omnes, utpote
stulti. The wise man of the Stoics is alone excepted. Consult note on
satire 1. iii. 77.—33. Si quid Stertinius verz* crepat. “ If Stertinius
utters any truth.'' The use of the indicative in this passage is intended
to express the full reliance which Damasippus has in the infallibility of
Stertinius. This Stertinius was a Stoic of the day, who left behind him,
according to the scholiast‚ two hundred and twenty volumes on the phi-
losophy of his sect, written in the Latin tongue l—Crepat. 'rhe peculiar,
force of this verb, in the present instance, is lost in a translation: It
refers to the authoritative tone assumed by Stertinius, in uttering his
oracles of wadon—35. Sapientem pascere barbam. “ To nurse a phi-
losophie beai-d ;'' i. e. a long and flowing one, the badge of wadum.-
36. Fabricio ponte. This bridge connected the island in the Tiber with
the left bank of that river. It was ereeted by L. Fabricius, superin-
tendant of ways, in the consulship of Q. Lepidus and M. Lollius, as an
