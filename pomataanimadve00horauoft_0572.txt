530 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Quamvis nil extra numerum fecisse modumque
Curas, interdum nugaris rure paterno: et
Partitur lintres exercitus ; Actia pugna
Te duce per pueros hostili more referturg
Adversarius est frater 3 lacus Hadria 3 donec
Alterutrum velox Victoria fronde coronet.
Consentire suis studiis qui crediderit te, 55
Fautor utroque tuum laudabit pollice ludum.
Protinus ut moneam (si quid monitoris eges tu)
Quid, de quoque vim, et cui dicas, saepe videto.
Percontatorem fugito: nam garmlus idem cst;
N ec retinent patulae commissa fideliter aures 3 70
Et semel emissum volat irrevocabile verbum.
N on ancilla tuum jecur ulceret ulla puerve
Intra marmoreum venerandi limen amici ;
N e dominus pueri pulchri caraeve puellae
Munere te parvo beet, aut incommodus angat. 75

“Out of number and measure ;” i. e. in violation of the rules and
measures of a just behnviour. *Numerus and modus are properly me-
trical ternis, the former denoting the rhythni, the latter indicating the
component feet, of a verse. They are here figuratively applied to the

fate depended on the pleasure of the people, wllO, if they wished him
to be saved‚ pressed down their thumbs (pollices premebant), and if to
be slain, turned them up (pollices vertebant ). Hence pollices premere,
‘⁵ to favour,” “to approve‚” ἃς. ; the populace only extending this in-
dulgence to such gladiatms as had conducted themselves bravely.
67—82. 67. Protinus ut moneam. ‘⁴ To proceed still farther in my

pessmus—75. lllunere te parvo leet. “Gratify thee by the trifling
present, ·” i. e. lay thee under obligations by so trifling a present.—
Aut incommodus anqat. “Or torment thee by not complying with thy
wish! ’-76. Etiam atquo etiam adspice. “consider again and again)
