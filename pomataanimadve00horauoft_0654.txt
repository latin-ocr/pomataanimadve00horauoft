67. C Q. HORATH FLACCI

Placari Genius festis impune diebus,

Accessit numerisque modisque licentia major.

Indoctus quid enim saperet liberque laborum

Rusticus, urbano conquUS, turpis honesto ἲ

Sic priscae motumque et luxuriem addidit arti

Tibicen, traxitque vagus per pulpita vestem ε 215

the increase of wealth which conquest produced. As regards the phrase
placari Genius, consult note on Ode 111. xvii. 14.

212—214. 212. Indoctus quid enim saperet, &c. “For what cor—
rect means of judging in such a case could an unlettered clown, and
one just freed from labour, have, when mingled in motley groupe with
the citizen-the base-born with him of honourable birth ‘P' There is
some difference of opinion with regard to the application οἲ these lines.
Many critics imagine that the poet refers to the rude and simple
character of the early theatrica] music, as taking its tone from the
unpolished nature of the audience to whom it was addressed. Others,
however, with more propriety‚ make the passage under consideration
have allusion to what immediately precedes, and to be intended as a
species of explanatory comment on the licentia major spoken of by
Horace—214. Sic priscae motumque et luxuriem, Sco. “Thus the mu-
sician added both a quicker movement and richer lnodulation to the
ancient art.'' By priscae arti is meant the ancient music, the peculiar
defects of which were, l. That it moved too slowly3 and 2. That it
had no compass¹ or variety of notes. It was the office of those who
played on musical instrumente„ in the performance both of tragedies
and comedies, 'to give the actors and audience the tone of feeling
which the dramatic parts demanded. ,In tragedy the music invariably
accompanied the chorus. It was not, however, confined to the chorus,
but appears to have been also used in the dialogue, or at least the
monologue of the scenes; for Cicero tells of Roscius, that he said he
would make the music play slower when he grew older, that he might
the more easily keep up with it. (De Orat. i. 60.) It is not pro-
bable, however, as some think, that comedy was a musical performanee
throughout3 Mr. Hakains, after quoting a number of authorities to
this purpose, concludes that comedy had no music but between the
acts, except perhaps occasionally in the case of marriages and sacrifices,
if any such were represented on the stage. (Hawkins' Inquiry into
Greek and Latin Poetry‚ ᾗ 13.—Dunlop’s Roman Literature, vol. i.

up and down, drexv a lengthened train along the stage. The put·
picum was awooden platform‚ raised on the proscenium to the height
of five feet. This the actors ascended to perform their parts3 and here
all the dramatic representations of the Romans were exhibited, except
the Mimes, which were acted on the lower fioor of the proscenium.--
Vestem; alluding to the long theatrical robe called σύρμα by the
Greeks, from σὺρω, “ to d1·ag'’ upon the ground. The present passage
expresses not only the improvement arising from the ornament of pro-
per dresses, but also that resulting from the grace of motion: not only
