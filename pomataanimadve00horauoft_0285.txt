EPODON LIBER. 5. 245

Quibus superbam fugit ulta pellicem,
Magni Creontis filiam,
Quum palla, tabo munus imbutum, novam 65
Incendio nuptam abstulit?
Atqui nec herba, nee latens in asperis
Radix fefellit me locis.
Indormit unctis omnium cubilibus
Oblivione pellicum.—-· 70
Ah! ah! solutus ambulat veneficae
Scientioris carmine.
Non usitatis, Vare, potionibus,
O multa fleturum caput !
Ad me recurres: nec vocata mens tua. 75

ironical one. Canidia does not refer to any actual unguent of her own
pmpafing, but to the virtues of the magic hei-bs which are to be all-
powerful in recalling the inconstant Varus.-—-61. Quid accidit, διο. The
dash at the end of the preceding verse is placed there to denote that
Canidia, after having procecded thus far with her incantatione, pauses in
expectation of the arrival of Varus, which is to be their intended result.
When this, however, is delayed longer than she imagined it would be,
the sorceress resumes her spell: “ What has happened? Why are my
direful drugs less powerfnl than those of the barbarian Medea?” i. e.

unctis, ἃς. The ordei· of construction is as follows: “ Indormz't cubilibus
(minium aliarum pellicum, unctis oblivione mei.” The expression unctis
oblivione mei is entirely figurative, as if the beds, to which she alludes,
had been perfuined with drugs which inspired varus with a complete
sorgetfulness of herself—71. Ah! ah! solutus, ἃς.. At the conclusion
of the last verse, Canidia is supposed to stand for a. moment lost in medi-
tation as to the cause which could have rendered her spells so ineffieient.
On a sudden, discovering the reason, she exclaims, “ Ah! ahl he roves
about, set free by the charin of some more skilful sorceress.”—-73. Non

Ο Varus, (thou that art destined to shed many tears‚) shalt thou return to
