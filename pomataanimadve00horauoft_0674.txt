630 Q· HoRATn FLACCI

Assentatores jubet ad lucrum ire po'e'ta 420
Dives agris, dives positis in fenore nummis.

Si vero est, unctum qui recte ponere possit,

Et· spondere levi pro paupere, et eripere atris

Litibus implicitum, mirabor si sciet inter-

Noscere mendacem verumque beatus amicum. 425
Tu seu donaris, seu quid donare voles cui 3

Nolito ad versus tibi factos ducere plenum

Laetitiae; clamabit enim, Pulchre ,Ι bene ! recte!

Pallescet super his ; etiam stillabit amicis

Ex oculis rorem ; saliet, tundet pede terram. 430
Ut, quae conductae plorant in funere, dicunt

Et faciunt prope plura dolentibus ex animo 3 sic

Derisor vero plus laudatore movetur.

and exposed thereby, (so important had been the service of timely ad-
vice) to the contempt and scorn of the public.'’—420. Assentaioresjubet
ad lucram ire po'e‘ta, ἃς. Supply sic, or ita, before assentatores. Faithful
friends, as has already been stated in the preceding note, are necessary
in order to apprise poets of their errors. Such friends, however, are dif-
ficult to be obtained by rich and powerful bards. Horace very justly
compares a wealthy poet to a public crier: the latter brin'gs crowds
together to buy up what is exposed sor sale ; the former is sure to collect
around him a set of base and venal flatterers. And if he is one who
gives good entertainmentS, and whose purse is open to the needy and
unfortunate, then sarewell to any means, on his part, of telling a true
friend from a false ona—4⁸22. Unctum qui recte ponere possit. “ Who
can entertain a guest well ;'' i. e. who cau give a good entertainment.
Ponere refers literally to the disposing of the guests on the couches in
the banqueting room. Unctum is equivalent here to convivam, and
alludcs to the custom of perfuming before lying down to an entertain-
ment.——423. Et spondere levi pro paupere. “And become security for
a poor man who has little credit of his own.’⁷—Atris. “Vexatious ;’'
equivalent to misere vexantibus—425. Beatus. “ Our wealthy bard.”
426—432. 426. Donam's ,· for donaveris. The poet advises the elder
Piso never to read his verses to a person on whom he has bestowed
any present, or who expects to receive one from him. A venal friend
cannot be a good critic ε he will not speak his mind freely to his patron,
but, like a corrupt judge, will betray truth and justice for the sake
of interest.—4·29. Super his ,· equivalent to insuper, or praeterea.—
Etz'am stillabit amicis ex oculis rorem. “ He will even cause the dew
to fall drop by drop from his friendly eyes.'' Rorem is here put for
lacrimas by a pleasing figure—431. Ut, quae conductae plorant in
sunere. “ As the mourning-women, who, being hired, lament at fune-
rals;'’ i. e. who are hired to lament at funerals. These were the prce-
ficae, who were hired to sing the funeral-song, or the praises of the
deceased, and to lament their departure.——432. Dolentibus ex animo.
