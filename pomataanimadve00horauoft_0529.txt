stain ;” i. e. of respectable parents.—57. Et properare Ioco et ces-sarr,
ἃς. “ That he was wont, as occasion required, to ply liis business with
activity and take his case, to gain a little and spend it.'' Loco is here
equivalent to tempore appeninum—58. Gaudentem parvis sodalibus, ce
lare cerlo, ὅτε. “ Delighting in a few companions of humble life, and in
a house of his own, and also in the public shows, and, when the business
of the day was over, in a walk through the Campus Martius.”

60-65. 60. Scituri libet etz· ipso, ecc. “1 would know from the man
himself all that thou reportest.''—6·2. Beniyne. ‘² I thank thy master
kindly.'' Menas expresses his thanks for the honour of the invitation.
but at the same time declines accepting it.—63. [mprobus. ‘² The ras-
oel.”--Et te myli-qil aut horret. “ And either slights, or is afraid of,
thee.'' Horrere and horror are properly meant of that awe and respect
which we feel when approaching any thing sacred 3 and as the wilgar zm¹
apt to look upon great men as somewhat above the ordinary rank of
mor-tals, the same words have been used to express the respect they feel
when admitted to their presence, as well as the dread they have of coni-
ing into it.-64. Vulteium mane Philippus, bec. “ N ext morning Philip
eomes upon Vulteius, as he was selling old second-hand trumpery to the
poorer sort of people, and salutes him first.” The verb occupare, as herc
employed, mfflns to surprise, to come upon another before he is aware of
our approach—65. Tunicato popello. This expression literally refers
m the poorer part of the citizens as clad merely in tnnics, their poverty
preventing them from purchasing a toga in which to appear abroad.
Foreigners at Rome seem also to have had the same dress, whence homo
tunicatus is put for a Carthaginian‚. Plaut. Poenul. v. iii. 2.-Scrztt‹z.
By this term is meant any kind of old second-hand furniture, movables,
clothes, διε. and they who vended them were called scrutarii. Menas
was spoken of in a preceding line (56th) as a prceco, or c1·ier; and
among the duties of this class of persons was that of 'attending at auc-
tions, and calling out the price bidden for the articles put up. This
would allow Menas many opportunities of making bai-gains for himself,
and, when not otherwise employed, of becoming a scrutarius.

66—7‘2. 66. Ille Philippo eoecusare laborem, &c. “ He began to
plead to Philip his laborious vocation and the fetters of hire, as an
excuse for not having waited upon him that morning ; in fine, for not
having seen him first.'' The expression mercenaria vincla refers to his
