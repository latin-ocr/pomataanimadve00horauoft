238 Q. HORATII FLACCI

that were to be yoked by Jason, as one of the conditions of his obtaining
from Aeetes the golden fleece.--12. Perunoez't hoc Iasonem. Medea
gave Jason an unguent, with which he was to anoint his person, and by
the virtues of which he was to be safe from harm. The poet pleasantly
asserts, that this was none other than the juice of garum-13. H oo deli-
butis, ἃς. “ By presents infected with this, having taken vengeance on
her rival, she fied away on a winged serpent ;” alluding to the fate of
Creusa, or Glauce, the daughter of Creon, and the ssight of Medea

through the air in a ear drawn by winged serpeuts.--15. Neo tantus '
