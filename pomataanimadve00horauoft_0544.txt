502 Q. HORATII FLACOI

Confestim liquidus Fortunae rivus inauret;
Vel quia naturam mutare pecunia nescit, ω
Vel quia cuncta putas una virtute minora.

Miramur, si Democriti pecus edit agellos
Cultaque, dum peregre est animus sine corpore velox ;
Quum tu inter scabiem tantam et contagia lucri
Nil parvum sapias, et adhuc sublimia cures ; 15
Quae mare compescant causae3 quid temperet annum 3
Stellae sponte sua, jussaene vagentur et errent ,-
Quid premat obscurum Lunae, quid proferat orbem ;
Quid velit et possit rerum concordia discors ;

10—-13, 10. Vel quia naturam, &c. The poet here amuses him-
self with the philosophie preteusions of Iccius, and involves him in a
ludicrous and awkward dilemma. The train of ideas is as follows:
What? art thou a philosopher, and dost thou complain of not being
richer? Suppose that wealth were to come suddenly into thy posses-
sion, what wouldst thou gain from such a state of things Ξ) evidently
nothing. For thy present mode of life is either the result of thy natural
feelings, or of thy philosophy. Is it of the former Ρ Gold cannot change
thy nature. Is it of the latter Ρ Thy philosophy teaches thee that virtue
alone contributes to true happiness. The whole· argument is keenly
ironieal.--12. Miramur, si Democriti, ἃς. The train of ideas is as
follows: We wonder at the mental abstraction of Democritus, who
was·so wrapped up in his philosophical studies as to neglect entirely the
care of his domestic concems, and allow the neighbouring flock to feed
upon his fields and cultivated grounds ; but how much more ought we
to wonder at thee, Iccius, who canst attend at the same time to thy
pecuniary affairs, and the investigation os philosophy, and not, like
Democritus, sacrifice the former to the latter! Ironical.—Democriti.
Democritus was a native of Abdera in Thrace, and the successor of
Leucippus in the Eleatic school. He was contemporary with Socrates,
Anaxagoras, Archelaus, Parmenides, Zeno, and Protagoras. The story
here told of him deserves little credit, as well as the other, which states
that he gave up his patrimony to his country. He is commonly known
as the laughing philosopham—13. Dum pereyo-e est animus sine corpore
veiooe. Horace in this follows the Platonic notion, that the soul, when
employed in contemplation, was in a manner detached from the body,
that it might the more easily mount above earthly things, and approach
nearer the ohjects it desired to contemplate.

14—-19, 14. Inter scabiem tantam et contagia lucri. “ Amid so
great impurity and infection of gain.”—-l5. Adhuc. ‘⁶ Still ;’' equivalent
to nunc quaqua—16. Quae mare compescant causae. “ What causes
set bounds to the sea.”—Quz'd temperet annum. “ What regulates the
changes of the year.”—l7. Stellae sponte sua, &c.; alluding to the
planeta—18. Quid premat obscurum lunae, ἅτε. “ What spreads obscu-
rity over the moon, what brings out her orb ;·'' i. e. what occasions the
eclipses of the moon, what the re-appearance of her light—19. Rerum
