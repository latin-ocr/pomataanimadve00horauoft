Epis‘rOLA AD Plsonns. 605
Sessuri, donee cantor, Vos plaudite, dicat: 155

Aetatis cujusque notandi sunt tibi mores,
Mobilibusque decor naturis (landus ct annis.
Reddere qui voees jam scit puer, et pede corto
Signat humum, gestit paribus colludere, et iram
Colligit ac ponit temere, et mutatur in horas. 160
Imberbus juvenis, tandem custode remoto,
' Gaudet equis canibusque et aprici gramine campi;
Cereus in vitium flecti, monitoribus asper,
Utilium tardus provisor, prodigus aeris,

Epist. 11. i. 189.--155. Vns plaudite. All the old tragedies and eome-
dies acted at Rome concluded in this manner. The phrase is equivalent
to our modern expression, ‘⁴ Your planditsss' or, “clap your hands.’'
who the cuntot· was that addressed these words to the andience, is a
matter of disputo. Dacier thinks it was the whole chorus ; others sup-
pose it to have been a single actor 3'sonie, the prompter ; and some, the
composer. The second of these opinions is probably the more correct
one.--156. Aetatis cujusque notandi sant tibi mores, ἃς. The manners
must be well distinguished, and strongly marked, designandi, expri-
mendi. The connexion in the frain of ideas is given by Hurd as fol-
lows z ·“ But though the strict observanee of these mles will enable the
poet to conduct his plot to the best advantage, yet this is not all that
is required in a perfect tragedy. If he would seize the attention⁷ and
secure the applause of the audience, something fanher must be at-
tempted. He must 'be particularly* studious to express the manners.
Besides the peculiaritics of affice, temper, condition, country, &e before
considered, all which require to be drawn with the utmost fidelity‚ a
singular attention must he had to the characteristic differences of aye.”
--157ιι Mobilibusque decm- neutris dandus et annis. ‘⁶ And a suitable
character assigned to varying dispositions and years ;‘' i. e. a certain
decorum or propriety must be ohserved in depicting the natures or
dispositions of men, as they vary with years.

158-165. 158. Reddere voces. “To express himself in words ;'’
i.e. who has now learnt to spcak.· ( Qui ex inj'antejamsactns est puer.)
The poet here begins with a beautiful description of the different ages
of life, based, in a great degree, upon the description given by Aris-
totle in his Art of Rhetorica—159. Gestit paribus colludere. Com-
pare Aristotle, Rhet. ii. 11. καὶ φιλόφιλοι, και φιλέταιροι, μᾶλλον τῶν
ἄλλων ἡλικιῶν.-Ι·ἶε iram colligit ac pmzit temere. “And is quick in
contracting and in laying aside angel-,⁰ Compare Aristotle, ibid. καὶ
θυμικοὶ καὶ ὀξύθυμοι, καὶοῖοι ἀκολουθεῖν τῇ ὁρμῇ-160. Εἰ mutatur in
horas. Compare Adstotle, ibidaelspsrcifioxoz δὲ καὶ ἁψίκοροι πρὸς τὰς
ἐπιθυμίας.·-161. Tandem custode remota. The word taudem marks,
in -a very pleasing manner, the impaticnee of the young to be freed
from restraint—162. ‚Et aprici gramine cumpi,- alluding to the gym-
nastic exercises wont to be. performed in the Campus Martius.-—l(i.'l.
serens in vitiam flecti. “As pliable as wax in being bent towards
vice.'' With cereus compare the Greek κήρινος.-164. Utiliam tardus
