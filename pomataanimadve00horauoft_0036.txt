xxxii METRES OF HORACE.

18. GREATER Arene.

This metro, so called from the poet Alcaeus, consists of two feet pron
perly both iambi, and a long catalectic syllable, followed by a choriambus
and an iambus3 the caesural pause always falling after the catalectic
syllable 3 as,

Vides 1 m culta ΙΙ πει niv& canldidzzm.
But the first foot of the iambic portion is alterable of course to a

spondee, aud Horace much more frequently has a spondee than an iambus
in this place 3 as

ὃ meilis& ΡᾶῖΙοῘινᾶ 11ῇῖΞᾶ ριῖἰΙοῘινΞὸν.

The Alcaic verse is sometimes scanned with two dactyls in the latter
member3 as,

Vides Ι ἤι <illm ῃ stet πῑυέ 1 candidam.

19. Ancnrnocmnr HEPTAMETER.

This species of verse consists of two members, the first a Dactylic
tetrameter ιι priore, (vide No. 2. in notis,) and the latter a Trochaic
Dimeter Brachycatalectic: that is, the‘first portion of the line hoff-d
taius four feet from the beginning of a Dactylie Hexameter,*,the
fourth being always a dacty13 and the latter portion consiste of three
trochees3 as, ’

δ’ῦῐυῖίίὶν 2 ᾶονὶε ῙιῖῙὲφηε 9νᾶ1ιᾶ vie? ΙΙ veris Ι &t ΡὶἱῙυόηΞ.

20. Mmon Arene.

This metre consists of two dactyls followed by two trochees3 as

Εέυἷᾶ Ι ρένεὸηὔΙένὲ Ι scitii.

21. DAc‘rleco-Ismmc.

This measure occurs in the 2d, 4th, and other even lines of the llth
Epode of Horace, as it is arranged in this edition. The first part of the

verse is a Dactylic Trimeter Cataleotic‚ (No. 3.) the latter part is an lambio
Dimeter3 (No. 7.) as,

δ’σνῐόἔνέ Ι ἰ’ἒνεῖσῑὶΙῐδε ΙΙ amalr? pbrlczilszim Ι 9νᾶυἱ.

One peculiarity attendant on this metre will need explanation. In
consequence of the uniou of two different kinds of verse into one line,
a license is allowed the poet with rogard to the final syllable of the
first verse, both in lengthening short syllables, and preserving vowels from-
elision; as,

Epod. xi. line 6. Inachia furere, silvis, ὅτε.
- 10. Aryuit, et latere petitus, διο.
- 26. Libera consilia, nee, διο.
- 14. Fervidiore mero arcana, &c.
— ⁴24. Vincere mollitia, amor, διο.
