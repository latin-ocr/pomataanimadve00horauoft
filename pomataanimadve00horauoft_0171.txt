CARMINUM LIB. 111. 3. 131

Virtus, recludens immeritis niori γ’
Coelum, negata tentat iter via :
Coetusque vulgares et udam
Spernit humum fugiente penna.

Est et fideli tutav silentio 25
Merces : vetabo, qui Cereris sacrum
Vulgarit arcanae, sub isdem ⁴
Sit trabibus, fragilemve meeum

Solvat phaselon. Saepe Diespiter
Neglectus incesto addidit integrum 3 30
Raro antecedentem scelestum

Deseruit pede Poena claudo.
