Thus when they affirmed, it was Aio .· When they denied, N8903 and,
when the point required deliberation, their form of reply was, Deliberan-
dum sentia—7. Erat. The Latin and English idioms differ here. We
translate erat asif it were esset, whereas in the original the advantage
referred to is spoken of as something actual, in the indicative mood,
though the circumstances which would have realized it never have taken
place.— Verum nequeo dormire. The sentence is elliptical, and, when
completed, will run as follows: “But I can't sleep at night, and thera
fore, to fill up the time, I write verses.'’-Ter uncti transnanto, ἃς.
“ Let those who stand in need of deep repose, having anointed them-
selvae, swim thrice across· the Tiber.'' Some commentators suppose,
that the anointing with oil, which is here alluded to, is recommended in
the present instance in order to give more pliancy to the limbs in swim-
ming. It would seem, however, to reser rather to the Roman gymnastic
exercises, preparation for which was always made by anointing the body,
and which were generally succeeded by swimming. Hence the advice
which Trebatius gives the poet is simply this, to go through a course of
gymnastic exercises, then swim thrice across the T iber, and lastly, end
the day with plenty of wine. ( I rrigyuumque mero sub noctem, διε.) These
directions on the part of Trebatius are intended to have a sly allusion to
his own habits, and, like an honest, good-natured physician‚ he is made
to praescribe for Horace two things which he himself loved best ; swim-
ming and drinking—8. Transnanto. This form is of a legal character,
and therefore purposely used on the present occasion. It is chiefly
employed for the sake of emphasis in the wording of laws.

11—17. 11. Caesaris. Augustus—12. Pater. Trebatius was now
advanced in years, hence the customary appellation of pater.—-l3.
Hor-rencia pilis aymina. The allusion here is to the Roman battalia,
the pilum being peculia: to the Roman troops—14. Fracta pereuntes
