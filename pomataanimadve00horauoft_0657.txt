Nec sic enitar tragico differre colori,

nomina solum, διο. The common text has inornata, for which we have
substituted houm-atu, the emendation of llurd. In support of his cor-
rection the critic remarks as follows 2—1. 'l'he context, Ι think, requires
this change. For' the two faults observed above, (v. 229, 280) were
first, a too low expression, and secondly, a too lofty. corresponding
to this double charge, the poet, having fixed the idea of this species of
composition, (v. 231, 232„ 233) should naturally be led to apply it to
both points in question ; first, to the cornio part, in describing the true
measure os its condescension3 and, secondly, to the tragic, in settling
the true bounds ot* its clevation( And this, according to the reading
here offered, the poet does, only in an inverted order. 'she sense of
the whole would be this,

l. AVon οφ) honorata et durninantia nomina solum,
Verbaque, Pisones, satyrorum scriptor amabo:

i. e. in the tragic scenes Ι would not confine mysclf to such words
only as are in honour, and bear rule in tragic and the most serious sub·
,ἰεῦ-ως this stateliness not agreeing with the condescending levity of the
satu-e.

2. Neo ‘sic enitar tra-(lico differre colori
Ut nihil intersit, Davusne loquatur et audax
Pythias, emuncto lucrata Simone talentum,
An custos famulusque dei Silenus alumni.

i. e. nor, on the contrary, in the comio scenes, would I incur the othe‘r
extreme of a too plain and vulgar expression, this as little suiting' its
inherent matron-like dignity. But 11. 'l'his correction improves the'
expression, as well as the sense. For, besides the opposition implied in
the disjunctive nec, which is this way restored, dominantia has now its
genuine sense, and not that strange and foreign one forced upon it out
of the Greek language. As connected with honorata, it becomes 'a
meta hor, elegantlypursued, and hus, too, a singular propriety‚ the'
poet ere speaking of figurative terms. And then, for honorata itse'lf‘,
it seems to have been a familiar mode of expression with Horace(
Thus (Epist. 11. ii. 112.) “honore indigna vocabula are such words as
have parum splendoris, and are sine pondere.'¹ And “quae ‚sunt in
honore 'vocabula'' is spoken of the contrary ones, such as are fit to enter
into a serious tragic composition, in this very epistle, line 71. (Hurd’s
Horace, vol. i. p. 202. seqq.) The meaning given to dominantia from
the Greek, and to which the learned bishop alludes, may be best ex-
plained in the words of Gesner: “ Dmninantia ex Graeco expressum
est, κύρια, i. e. propria, quibus contraria sunt ἄκυρα. Sic domicilium
habere dicitur verbum in ea re, de qua proprie, κυρίως, adhibetur. Cic.
