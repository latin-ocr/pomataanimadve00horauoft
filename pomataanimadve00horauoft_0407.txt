Scaevae vivacem crede nepoti, &c. The poet here, in his usual manner,
so manages his argument, as to convert it into a means of lashing one of
the abandoned characters of the day. The train of thought is as follows:
But Scaeva, the spendthrist, one will say, is an exception to my rule:
for he makes no use whatever of the weapons of attack that nature has
bestowed upon him ; he employs open violence against no being. Ay!
entmst his aged mother to his power. He won't do her any open
harm. O! no, he is too pious for that. But he will remove the old
woman by a secret dose of poison. According to the scholiast, Scaeva
poisoned his mother because she lived too long.-53. ancem matrem.
“ His long-lived mother.''—54. Pia. Iromca1.-Mirum, ut neque calce
lupus, Rc. “A wonder indeed! just as the wolf does not attack any
one with his hoof, nor the ox with his teeth.'' Wonderful indeed! ob-
serves the poet ; how, pray, do other animals act? since the wolf does
not attack with his hoof but his fangs, and the ox not with his teeth but
his horn. Horace does not mean to diminish the criminality of Scaeva's
conduct, because he secretly made away with his mother; on the con-
, vary, he considers it equally as criminal as if he had been guilty of
open and violent parricide. His leading position must be borne in
mind, that all, whether men or animals, have their own ways of attack
and defence, and that he too has his, the writing of satires.—56. Mala

shall be the complexion of my life.''—O puer, ut sis vitalis, metuo. “ My
son, 1 am afraid that thou wilt not live long.'' Aster the verbs metuo,
timeo, vereor, ne is used when the following verb expresses a result con-
trary to our wish, ut when it is agreeable to it. Trebatius wishes
Horace to enjoy a long life, but is afraid he will not. Hence ne aster
such verbs must be rendered by that, and ut by that ποι-61. Et
