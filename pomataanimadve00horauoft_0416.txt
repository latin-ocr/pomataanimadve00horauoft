374 Q. HORATII FLAOCJ

caulibus instillat, veteris non parcus aceti.
Quali igitur victu sapiens utet-ur? et horum
Utrum imitabitur? Hac urguet lupus, hac canis, aiunt.
Mundus erit, qui non offendat sordidus, atque 65
In neutram partem cultus miser. Hic neque servis,
Albuci senis exemplo, dum munia didit,
Saevus erit 3 neque sic ut simplex Naevius unctam
Convivis praebebit aquam3 vitium hoc quoque magnum.
Accipe nunc, victus tenuis quae quantaque secum 70
Afferat. Imprimis valeas bene: nam variae res
Ut noceant homini, credas, memor illius escae,

were his whole store ; and it was of horn, that it might last the longer.
—62. Veteris mm parcus aceti. ThiS, at first view, seems not to agree
withthe close and sordid character of Avidjenus, because old vinegar- is
always the best. Hence some commentators have been disposed to
make veteris, in the present passage, mean ‘⁶ stale ” or “ flat.” On the
other hand, Gesner thinks the early reading, non largus aceti, would an-
swer better than the received one. There appears to be no necessity,
however, for either the one or the other of these remarks. Old vinegar-
was not more costly than new, and besides it would serve better to con-
quer the taste of his oil.

64—68. 64. Utrum; alluding ‘to the case of Gallonius on the one
hand, and that of Avidienus on the other. Compare the scholiast3
‘⁶ Utrum5 Gallonium cm Avidienum ?”—Hac urguet lupus, δίο. “ 011
this side, as the saying is, presses the wolf, on that the dog.''' We have
here a proverbial form of expression, used whenever one was between
two dangers equally threatening. In the present instance the adage
applies with remarkable felicity, lupus denoting the glutton, and canis
Avidienus.—65. Mundus erit, qui mm offendat sordidus, &c. ‘⁴ He
will be regarded as one that observes the decencies and proprieties of
life, who does not offend by sordid habits, and who gives no occasion
for censure by running into either extreme of conduct 3³⁵ i. e. by either
carrying a regard for the proprieties of life too far on the one hand, or in-
dulging in sordjdness or want of cleanliness (whether intentional or the
result of careless habits) on the other. Of each of these opposite cha-
racters an example is given: the one carrying a regard for exactness and
precision to such an extreme as to punish his slaves for the most trifling
omission3 and the other, a good-natured, easy, and indulgent master,
who lets his slaves act just as they please ; and the consequence of which
is, that these negligent domestics even serve greasy water (unctam
aquam) to his guests.—67. Dum munia didit. “ While he assigns
them their several employments.” The tyrannical master punishes
beforehand, in anticipation of the offenee.—68. Simplex Naevius.
‘⁶ The easy, good-natured Naevius. ”-— Unctam aquam. “ Greasy
water.''

71-77. 71. Variae res. “A mixture of one's food ;” equivalent‚
literally, to varia ciborum yenera.—72. .Memor illius escae, &c. “ When
