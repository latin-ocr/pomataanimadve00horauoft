fervor. ‘⁴ The glow of resentment.’' The poet lays the blame of his
injurious effusion on the intemperate feelings of youth.—24. Celeres
iambos. ‘¹ The rapid iambics.'’ The rapidity of this measure rendered it

Ona XVII.—Horaee‚ having, in the last ode, made his peace with
Tyndaris, now invites her to his Sabine farm, where she will find retire-
ment and security from the brutality of Cyrus, who had treated her
with unmanly rudeness and eruelty. In order the more certainly to

Latius, appears to Have been identical with the Pan οἱ the Greeks.—
3. Defendit. “ Wards off.⁷’——4. Pluviosque ventos. ‘⁶ And the rainy
winds.” The poet sufficiently declares the salnbrious situation οἷ’ his
Sabine farm, when he speaks of it as being equally sheltered from “the
flery heats of summer‚'' and ‘⁴ the rain-bearing winds‚’' the sure precursors
of diseaso.
