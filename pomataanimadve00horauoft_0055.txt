CARMEN V.
AD PYRRHAM.

Qms multa gracilis te puer in rosa
Perfusus liquidis urguet odoribus

lofty dwellings of the rich. ” Horace uses tho term rex· as equivalent to
beatus or dives. As regards the apparent want of connexion between this
portion of the ode, and that which immediately precedes, compare what has
been said in the introductory remarks—15. I nchfoare. ‘⁶ Day after day
to renew.”—16. Jam te premet nom, &c. The passage may be pam-
phrased as follows z “ Soon will the night of the grave descend upon thee,
and the manes of fable crowd around, and the shadowy home of Pluto
become also thine own.'' The zeugma in the verb premo, by which itis
made to assume a new meaning in each clause of the sentence, is worthy of
notice. By “the manes of fable ⁷’ are meant, the shades of the de·
par-ted, osten made the theme of the wildest fictione of poetry. Some com-
mentators‚ however, understand the expression in its literal sense, “the
manes of whom all is fablc‚’' and suppose it to imply the disbelief osa
future state.

,, 17-18. 17. Simul, sor Simul ac.—-18. Talis. This may either be
the adjective, or else the ablative plural, of talus. If the former, tho
meaning of the passage will be, “Thou shalt neither cast lotz-..for the
sovereignty of such wine as we have here, n01·‚'' διο. ὫἮιειῈαε, if talis be
regarded as a noun, the interpretation will bc, ‘⁶ Thou shalt neither cast lots
with the dice for the sovereignty of wine, nor,’⁷ &e This latter mode
of rendering the passage is the more usual one, but the other is cer-
tainly more animated and poetical, and more in accordance, too, with the
very early and eurious belief of the Greeks and Romans in relation to a
future state. 'Lhey believed that the souls of the departed, with the ex-
ception of those who had offended against the majesty of the gods, were
occupied in the lower world with the uni-eal performance of the same
{effron‘s‘x‘vhich had formed their chief object of pursuit in the regions of
day. Thus the friend of Horace will still quaff his wine in the ‘shades‚
but the cup and its eontents will be, like their possessor, a shadow and
adream: it will not bc such wine as he drank upon the carth. As
regards the expression, “sovereigmy of wine‚'' it means nothing more
than the office of arbiter bibggz‘cgi, οι· “ toast-master.’' (Compare Ode rr.
vii. 25.)
