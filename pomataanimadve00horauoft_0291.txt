CARMEN IX.
AD MAECENATEM.

QUANDO repostum Caecubum ad festas dapes,
Victore laetus Caesare,
Tecum sub alta, sic Jovi gratum, domo,
Beate Maecenas, bibam,
Sonante mixtum tibiis carmen lyra, 5
Hac Dorium, illis barbarum 2
Ut nuper, actus quum freto Neptunius
Dux fugit, ustis navibus,
Minatus Urbi vincla, quae detraxerat
Servis amicus perfidis. 10
Romanus, eheu ! posteri negabitis,
Emancipatus feminae,
Fert vallum et arma miles, et spadonibus
Servire rugosis potest !
