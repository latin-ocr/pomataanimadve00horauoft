456 Q. HORATII FLACCI

V irtus post nummos. Haec Janus summus ab imo
Prodocet3 haec recinunt juvenes dictata senesque, 55
Laevo suspensi loculos tabulamque lacerto,

Est animus tibi, sunt mores, est lingua fidesque ;

Sed quadringentis sex septem millia desint:

Plebs eris. At pueri ludentes, Rem eris, aiunt,

Si recte facies. Hic murus ae‘neus estc, 62]
Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa.

Roscia, dic sodes, melior leX, an puerorum est

N aenia, quae regnum recte facientibus offert,

Et maribus Curiis et decantata Camillis?

Isne tibi melius suadet, qui, rem facias, rem, 65

never changes from a sense of crime—24. Haec Janus summus ab imo
prodocet.. “ These precepts the highest Janus from the lowest openly
inculcates ;” i. e. this is the language openly held by the money-dealers
of the day. Consult note on Sat. 11. iii. 18.—55. Prodocet. Pro has
here the same force in composition, as in producere, proferre, prodire,
διο. Haeo dictata. “ These maxims.”—56. Laevo suspensi loculos,
διο. Compare Sat. Ι, vi. 74.——58. Sed quadrivzyentis seoe septem millia
desint. “ But to complete the four hundred thousand sesterces, six or
seven thousand may be wanting.” Four hundred thousand sesterces was
the fortune which a person must possess before he could be enrolled
among the Equestrian order. It is on this rule that the remark of the
poet turns 2——Thou hast spirit, good morals, eloquence, and unshaken
fidelity, but it may so happen that thy fortune is not exactly equa] to
the equestrian standard: well then, a Plebeian wilt thou remain, and all
thy good qualities will be as dust in the balance.—-59. At pueri ludentes,
Rex eris, aiunt, διο. The play to which the poet here alludes, is sup-
posed to have been a kind of game at hall, in which the one who made
the fewest failures received the appellation of king—60. Hic murus
ae'neus esto, διο. This noble passage is introduced by the poet as a
species of parenthesiS, and springs naturally as it were from the cry of
the boys in their game. After having given it utterance, he returns, in
the 62d verse, to the regular course of his subject.

62—69. 62. Roscia lem alludingto the law of L. Roscius Otho,
which assigned to the equites, at the public spectades, fourteen tows of
seats, separate from the rest, and next the orchestra, or place where
the senators sat.——63. Naeuia. “ The song.” The common impert of

the term in question is, a funeral song or ‹urge—64. Et Muribus Curiis ’

et decantata Camillis. ‘⁴ Sung even in manhood both by the Curii and
the Camilli 3⁸³ hterally, ‘⁶ sung both by the manly Curii and Camilli.”
The idea intended to be conveyed is this, that the song of the boys,
offering the kingdom to those that do right, was not merely sung by
Curius and Camillus in the days of their boyhood, but the principle which
it inculcated was acted upon by them even in maturer years, and their
applause was given not to the rich, but to the virtuous and the good.—
65. Qui, ‘rem facias. “Who advises thee to make money, money, if
