us the names of the citizens, to jog us every now and then on the lest
side, and make us stretch ont our hand over all intervening obstacles.’'
What pondera actually refers to herc, remains a matter of mere conjec-
ture. The general allusion in this passage is to the office of nomenclator.
The Romans, when they stand candidate for any office, and wanted to
ingratiate themselves with the peop1e‚ went always accompanied by a
slave, whose sole business it was to learn the name and conditions of the
citizens, and secretly inform his master, that the latter might know how
to salute them by their proper names.

52—55. 5¹2. Hic multum in Fabia valet, διο. The slave now
whispers into his master's ear: ‘⁶ This man has great influence in the
Fabian tribe, that one in the Veline.’' With Fabia and Velina respec—
tively understand crim—53. Cui libet is fasces dabit, διο. The allusion
is now to a third person. By the term justes is meant either the consul-
ship or praetorship.—Curule ebur. ‘⁴ The curule chair.'’ The allusion
appears, from what precedes, to be to the aeslileship, or office of curule
aedile, although the sella curulis was common, in fact, to all the higher
magistrates—54. Importunas. “ Indefatigable in his efforts.''-†-Frater‚
Pater, adde. “Add the titles of Brother, Father.” Frater and Pater

accusatives3 but being supposed to be quoted, as it were, from the speech
of another, when they are used as vocatives, they remain unaltered in
form.—55. Ut cuique est aetas, &c. 'rho direction here given is as fol-

under, address him, in a familiar and friendly way, with the title of
‘⁴ Brother: ” if, however, he be an older man than thyself, approach him
raepectfully, and salute him with the name of “ Father.''—Facetus.
“ Courteously.”—Ad0pta. “ Adopt him ;'' i. e. adopt him into thy family
by this salutation, address him as a relation.

56—-67, 56. Lucet. “’Tis light ;’' i. e. the day is now breaking.—
57. Gula. “ Our appetite.’' The idea intended to be conveyed by the
whole clause is as follows: As soon as the day breaks let us attend to
the calls of appetite.———Piscemur‚ venemur. Instead of merely saying‚
Let us procure the materials for the banquet, the poet employs the com-
mon expressions in the text, ‘⁶ Let us go a-fishing‚ let us go a-huunting‚”
that he may bring in with more effect the mention of Gargilius—58.
