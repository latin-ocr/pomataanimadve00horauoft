FUNDANIUS.
In primis Lucanus aper: leni fuit Austro
Captus, ut aiebat coenae pater 3 acria circum

the name of the individual in question was Nasidienus Rufus-Beati ,·
equivalent to divitis, a usage of frequent occurrence in Horace—2.
Nam mihi convivam quaerenti, ἃς. Τ118 construction is, Nam dictus es
heri mihi quaerenti te convivam, potare illic de medio die. “ For I was
told yesterday, when seeking to make thee my guest, that thou wert
drinking there since noon.”›-3. De medio die ; equivalent in strietness
to a medio statim die. The usual time for the Roman coena was the
ninth hour, or three o’clock asternoon, in summer, and the tenth hour
in winter. It was esteemed luxurious to sup earlier than this ; and an
entertainment, therefore, begun before the usual time, and prolonged
till late at night, was called by way of reproach convivium tempestivum,
under which class the present one would fall. What is here stated
respecting the horn-s of the Roman coena, applies, cf course, only to
times of luxury and wealth. The primitive Romans supped at evening,
and made the prandium, or dinner, a hearty meal 3 whereas with their
descendants the prandium became a very slight repast, and „he coena
the principal meal.—Si(·‚ vut mihi nunquam in vita [αρτ-11 melius.

the south wind blew gently.'' The flesh of the boar, if the animal was
taken when the south wind blew violently, soon became. rancid, but, if
taken when the same wind blew gently, would be tender. Either by
buying it cheap, or by keeping it too long, the boar in question was .
probably tainted ; but the host would insinuate that it had a particular
flavour by being taken when the south wind blew gently, and was deli-
cate and temler—7. Acria circum rapula, &c The articles here men-
tioned were such as might best, by their sharp and pungent taste, over—
come the tainted flavour of the boar, as well as excite the guests to eat.
