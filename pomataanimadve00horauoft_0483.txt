SERMONUM Lm. 11. 8. 41ss

Indice monstraret digito: nam cetera turba,

Nos, inquam, coenamuS, aveS, conchylia, pisces,

Longe dissimilem noto· celantia succum ;

Ut vel continuo patuit, quum passeris assi et

Ingustata mihi porrexerat ilia rhombi. 30
Post hoc me docuit, melimela rubere minorem

Ad lunam delecta. Quid hoc intersit, ab ipso

Audieris melius. Tum Vibidius Balatroni:

Nos, nisi damnose bibimus, moriemur inulti ;

Et calices poscit majores. Vertere pallor 35
Tum parochi faciem, nil sic metuentis ut acres

Potores, vel quod maledicunt liberius, vel

Fervida quod subtile exsurdant vina palatum.

Invertunt Allifanis vinaria tota

finger.'' An individual who performed such a duty as this at an enter-
tainment was styled a nomenclator—26. Cetera turba. ‘⁶ The rest
of the company.”—·28. Lon-qe dissimilem noto, ἃς. “ Which conccaled
in thern a juice far different from the known one.” Hence the office
of Nomentanus in pointing out these hidden excellencies of the viands.
There is much malice, as Dacier well observes, in the ambiguous word-
ing of the text. The food, not being over-excellent in its kind, was dis-
guised by sauces and seasoning. Nomentanus declares its taste to be
very peculiar and delicate, while Fundanius ironically confesses he had
never caten any thing like it before—29. Passeris. “ Of a flounderss‘*
Understand marini. The fish here meant is the Pleuronectes Flesus ot'
ichthyologists.—30. Inyustata. “ Such as I had never before tasted.*'

31—38. 31. Μεῖίηιεῖσ. “Honey-apples.'' These properly belonged
to the second course, or dessmt, and their presence in this part of the
entertainment serves only to show how unaccustomed their host was to
the mles and proprieties of an ente1·tainment.-Mz·norem ad lunam. “ At
the waning moon.''-3·2. Quid hoc intersit. “ What difference this
makes ;'' i. e. whether they are gathcred when the moon is in her wane‚
or at any other time—34. Nos nisi damnose bibimus, διο. “ If we do
not drink to his eost, we shall die unrevengcd ;'' i. e. let us dn'nk hard,
and punish by so doing the foolish vanity, and sordid and ridiculous
avarice, of our host.——35. Vertere. Understand acepta—36. Paroehi.
“ Of our entertainer.”—38. Subtile exsurdant palatum. ‘⁶ Blunt the nice
perception of the palate.'' The true reason, the fear which Nasidienus
entertained for his wine, is ironically withheld. .

39—46. 39. Invertunt Allifanis vinaria tota. “ Empty whole wine—
jam into Allifanian cups ;'’ i. e. drain, by means of Allifanian cups, the
contents of entire wine-jars. With vinaria understand vasa, and poculis
with Allifanis. The Allifanian cup3, made at Allifae, a city of Samnium,
were of a larger size than usual. Hence the figurative language of the
text.—40. Imi convivae lecti ,· the allusion is to Nomentanus and
