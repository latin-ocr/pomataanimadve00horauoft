CARMINUM LIB. Ι. 1.

<1³

Hunc, si mobilium turba Quiritium

Certat tergeminis tollere honoribus:

Illum, si proprio condidit horreo

Quidquid dc Libyeis verritur areis. 10
Gaudentem patrios findere sarculo

Agros, Attalicis conditionibus

Nunquam demoveas, 111 trabe Cypria

Myrtoum pavidus nauta secet mare.

Luctantem Icariis fluctibus Africum 15
Mercator metuens, otium et oppidi

8. Certat tergeminis, &c. “vie with each other in raising him to the

cipal granaries of Rome was the fertile region adjacent 104110 811115 11111101,

Horace uses the epithet Libycis for Africis, in imitation of the Greek

writers, with whom Libya (Λιβύη) was a general appellation for the entire
continent of Africa.

11-—15. 11. §32ch ‘⁶ With the hoc.’' Sarculum is for sarri-
culum, from sarria—12. Attalicis conditionibus. “ For all the wealth

1115 riches, which he bcqueathed‚ together with his kingdom, to the Roman

here, not so much to the'‘comme1·ce of 1110 island, extensive as it was, as to

near the islanda of Icaria, Mycono, and Gyaros. It derived its name, not
as the ancient mytliologists pretend, from Icarus, the son of Daedalus, who,
according to them, fell into' it and was drowned, but from 1110 first of the
islands just mentioned, (Icaria, i. e. Icaure) the appellation of which
denotes, in the Phoenician language, “ the island of fish.'’ compare
Bochart‚ Geoyr. Sacr. i. 8.—Africum. The wind Africus denotes⁷ in
stn'ctness, ‘⁴ the west-south-Eestl' In translating the text it will be suffi-
cient to render it by ‘⁴ {nuth-westss’ It derived its name from the circum-
stance of its coming in the direction of Africa Propria.
