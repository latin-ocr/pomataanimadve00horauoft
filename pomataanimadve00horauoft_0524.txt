482 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Dum pueris omnis pater et matercula pallet,
Officiosaque sedulitas et opella forensis
Adducit febres et testamenta resignat.
Quod si bruma nives Albanis illinet agris, 10
Ad mare descendet vates tuus, et sibi parcet,
Contractusque leget: te, dulcis amice, reviset
Cum ZephyriS, si concedes, et hirundine prima.
Non, quo more piris vesci Calaber jubet hospes,
Tu me fecisti locupletem.-— Vescera sodes.—- 15
Jam satis est—At tu quantumvis tolle.-—Bem'{‚me.--
Non invisaferes pueris munuscula parvis.—
Tam teneor dono, quam si dimittar onustus.—
Ut libet, leaeo porcis hodie comedenda relinquis.—
Prodigus et stultus donat, quae spernit et odit. 20

usually came attended by a troop of inferior officers, called by Seneca

duties, served to keep off the crowd like the lictors of the magistrates,

Γαῖα. “ Tender mother.”—-8. Officio-sa sedulitas. “ An assiduous attend-
ance on the great.”——Opellaforensis. ‘⁴ The petty operations of the bar.''
-9. Testamenta resignat. The autumna} season‚ when the greatest
mortality prex-exiled, is here said, by the agency of assiduous attention
on the great, and by the distracting business of the bar, to open wills,
i. e. to kill ; wills never being opened until the death of the testator.

10—13. 10. Quod sz'. Referring here to time. “ When, however.”
-Alhanis; equivalent to Latinis—11. Ad mare. Lambinus thinks
the reference is here to the Sinus Tarentinus, an opinion which derives
support from verse 45, and also from Ode 11. xi. lO.—Stbi parcet. “ Be
careful of himself ;” i. e. will guard himself against whatever might
prove injurious to health.-l2. Contracta-sque ἱερεῖ. “ And will amuse
himself with reading in some snug little apartment.'' With contractus
supply in locum anyzcstum. There are other explanations, however, of
this clause. «13. leundme prima. . “With the first swallow3' ’22 e. in
the very beginning of the spring. Swallows denote the spring, and to
come back with the first swallow was to return vere prmo. '

14—28. 14. Non, quo more piris vesci, διο. ο The idea intended to
be convey ed is this: Thou hast not gifted me with what thou thyself
lespisedst, as the Calabrian rustic gave away his pears, or as a foolish
prodigal squanders upon others what he regards as contemptible and
v3alueless but thou hast bestowed such things upon thy poet as a good
