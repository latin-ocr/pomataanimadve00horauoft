252 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Interque signa turpe militaria 15
Sol adspicit conopium !
Ad hoc frementes verterunt bis mille equos
Galli, canentes Caesarem ;
Hostiliumque navium portu latent
Puppes sinistrorsum citae. 20
Io Triumphe ! tu moraris aureos
Currus, et intactas boves ;

Fert vallum et arma miles, διε. “ Bears the stake, and arms, as a sol—
dier, and can yield obedience to withered eunuchs.” The poet expresses
his indignation, that Romans, hardy enough to endure the toils of military
service, can, at the same time, be so wanting in spirit as to yield obedieneo
to the orders of eunuchs. The allusion, in the words fert vallum, is to
that part of Roman discipline which compelled each soldier to car-ry, among
other things, a certain number of stakes (usually three or four) to be used
in encamping.—Spadonibus. The allusion seems to be principally to the
eunuch Mardion, who, according to Plutarch, along with Pothinus, Iras,
and Charmion, had the chief direction of Cleopatra’s affairs (Ὑφ’ ὧν τὰ
μέγιστα διοικεῖται τῆς ἡγεμονίας. Plut. Vz't. Ant. 60. vol. vi. p. 132.
ed. Hutten.)—-15. Turpe conopium. “ A vile Egyptian canopy.’' The
conopium was a canopy‚ curtain, or veil of net-work, used for the purpose
of keeping off gnats and flies. It was principally employed by the Egyp-
tians, on account of the great number of these insects produced by the
marshes os the Nile. The scholiast, in his explanation of the-term, fur.
nishes us with its etymology: ‘⁴ Genu-s ‘retis ad muscas et culices
(κώνωπας) abigendos, quo Alexandrini potissimum utuntur propter culicum
illio abundantiam.” To a genuine Roman spirit the use of such an arti-
cle appeared degrading effeminacy.

17—22. 17. Ad hocfrementeS‚ &m “Indignant at this spectacle,
two thousand Gauls turned about their steeds, bidding Caesar hail.'’
The poet evidently alludes to the defection of Deiotarus aud Amyntas,
two leaders of the Gallo-Graeciam, or Galatians, who went over to
Augustus a short time previous to the battle of Actium. In the motive,
however, which Horace assigns for this step, there is more of bitter
sarcasm than historica] truth.— Verterunt. The penult is here shortened
by systole, as it is called.—l9. Hostiliumque navium portu latent, &c.
“ And the sterus of hostile ships, impelled towards the left, lie concealed
in the harbour.’' In order to undelstand clearly this somewhat obscure
passage, we must bear in mind, that the present piecc was written before
any very definite particulars respecting the battle of Actium had reached
the capital. The poet, therefore, exercises some liceuse on the occasion,
and supposes that a division of Antony's fleet, equally indignant with
the Gallie horsemen, retired from the fight into the harbour, and, in
order that their defection might be less apparent, rowed their vessels
astern, or impelled them into the harbour stern foremost. (Compare
the Greek expression, πρύμναν κρούσασθαι, and Valckenaer ad Herodot.
viii. 84) Iu executing this movcment they would have necessarily to
move towards the left, as Antony’s fiee-t was drawn up on the right and
facing Italy.--2l. Io Triumphe .' ἃς. The poet, personifying Triumph,
