208 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Deliae tutela deae, fugaces
Lyncas et cervos cohibentis arcu,

Lesbium servate pedem, meique :35
Pollicis ictum,

Rite Latonae puerum canentes,
Rite crescentem face Noctilucam,
Prosperam frugum, celeremque pronos
Volvere menses. 40

Nupta jam dices: Ego dis amicum,
*Saeculo festas referente luces,

Reddidi carmen, docilis modorum
Vatis Horati.

primae, διο. “ Ye noblest of the virgins, and ye boys sprung from illus-
tm'ous sires.’' The maidens and youths who composed the chorus at the
Secular celebration, and whom the poet here imagines that he has before
him, were choscn from the first families.-33. Deliae tutela deae. “ Ye
that are protected by the Delian Diana.” Diana was the patroness of moral
purity—35. Lesbium servate pedem, &c- ‘⁸ Observe the Lesbian
measure, and the striking of my thumb.” The expression pollicis ictum
refers to the mode ofmarking the termination of cadences and measums,
hythe application ofthe thunib to the stringe of the lyre.—38. Crescentem
face Noctilucam. ‘⁴ The goddess that illumines the night, increasing in the
splendour of her beams.”—39. Pro-speram fruyum. ‘⁴ Propitious to the
productioris of the earth.’' A Graecism for fruyibas.-Celeremque pronos,
&m “ And swift in rolling onward the rapid months.'’ A Graecism for
celerem in volvendis pronis mensibus.

41—43. 41. Nupta jam dices. “ United at length in the bande of

the beginning of this stanza, tui-ns to the maidens, and addresses him-
sels to the leader of the chorus as the representative of the whole body.
The inducement which hc holds out to them for the proper performance
of their part in the celebration is extremely pleasing3 the prospect,
namely, of a happy marriage3 for the ancients believed that the virgins
composiug the chorus at the Secular and other solemnitffis, were always
recompensed with a happy union.--42. Saeculo festas referente
nuces. “ WVhen the Secular period brought back the festa] days.'’ The
Secular games were celebrated once every hundred and ten years.
Before the Julian reformation of thc calendar, the Roman was a lunar
, year, which was brought, or was meant to be brought, into hermon)-
with the solar year, by the insertion of an intercalary mouth. Joseph

Scaliger has shown that the principle ’vas to intercalate a month,.

alternately of twenty—two and twenty-three days, every other year during
periods of twenty-two years; in each of which periods such an inter-
