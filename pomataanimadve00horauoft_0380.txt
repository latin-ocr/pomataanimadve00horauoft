340 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Flumen ut hibernum, fertur quo rara securis.

Tum Praenestinus salso multoque fluenti

Expressa arbusto regerit convicia, durus

Vindemiator et invictus, cui saepe viator 30
Cessisset, magna compellans voce cucullum.

At Graecus, postquam est Italo perfusus aceto,

Persius exclamat τ Per mafflws‘, Brute, deos te

Oro, qui reyes consuesti tollere ,· cur ozon

Η zmcRegem jugulas ,9 operum &mmihi crede, tuorum est. 35

ut hibernum, διο. “ He poured along, as a wintry flootl is wont, in places
whither the axe of the woodman se'ldom comes.'' Persius, choking with
rage while hc pours forth his torrent of angry invective against Rupilius, is
compared to a stream swollen by the winter rains, and choked in its
course by the thick underwood, and other impediments of the kind which
it encounters.

28—30. 28. Tum Praenestinus salso, &c. “ Then the native of
Praeneste, like a stubborn and unconquered vine-dresser, to whom the
passenger had often been obliged to yield‚ when calling him cuckoo with
roaring voice, retorts upon his opponent, as he flowed along in this cnt-
ting and copious style, invectives drawn as it were from the vulgar rail-
lery of the vineyard itself.” The vines in Italy were trimm'ed and pruned
early in the spring. If any vine-dresser, therefore, attended to this branch
of his duties late in the season, (the period when the cuckoo begins to

γ put forth his note,) he was sure of encounten'ng the raillery of passengers

for his indolence and loss of time3 and it was customary with them, in
allusion to the lateness of the season, in which his labours had only just
commenced, to salute his ears with the cry of cucullus (“ Cuckoo ;’' i. e.
in the vulgar dialect of our own days, “ lazy lubber.'’) On this a fieree
war of invective and abuse invariably ensued, and the more extensive
vocabulary of the vine-dressers generally ensured them the victory. Horace
compares Rupilius therefore to a vine-dresser who had been in many
such conflicts, and had always come off conqueror; in other words, he
pays a high compliment to his unrivalled powers of abuse.—29. Ar—
busto. The Italian vines were trained along trees. Hence the use of
arbustum to denote a vineyard.—30. Vindemiator. This term properly
denotes one who gathers the grapes for the vintage. lt is here used, how-
ever, in the sense of putator. In metrical reading, vindemiator must be ’
pronounced vindemyfitor.

32—35. 32. Graecus. Compare note on verse 2.—J talo ‹ze-etv. The
invectives and abuse uttered by Rupilius, are here designated by the appel-
lation of “ Italian vinegar.''—34. Qui reyes consuesti tollere. Brutus
had aided in slaying Caesar only, but J unius Brutus, one of his ancestor-s,
had driven Tarquin from Rome. Persius, however, was not, we may
well suppose, very deeply read in Roman history, and he therefore lud-i· ·
crously confounds the two, making the individual whom he addresses to
have removed out of the way both Caesar and Tarquin !—35. Operum
hoc, mihi crede, tuorum est. “ This is one, believe me, of the deeds that Δ
