Pulveris exigui prope ligus parva Matinum

Percurrisse polum, morituro !

ARCHYTAE UMBRA.

cannot agree in the propriety of such an interpretation. The peri-phrasis of
munera pulveris, with the two accompanying epithetS, is extremely hau-h,
nor is the sense at all improved by lhis mode of rendering, as far, at least,
aswe are able to decide. As for the examplcs of a similar periphrasis
which Jani undertakes to cite, it must be evident, upon the slightest in-
specfion, that they are not entitled to the name. In Lucretius, (i. 32,)
“munera belli '' is equivalcnt to “ bellicos labores ;’' and in Horace
himself, (Ode 11. i. 38) by munera naeniae arc meant, in fact, “ Ieyes

and is said to have invented a kind of-xssipged automaton, and several
curious hvdraulic machines. He was in such high reputation for moral

divinity. Horace follows the earlier sable, by which Tantalus is repre-
sented as honoured with a seat at the table of the gods, and as having
incuned their displeasure bv imparting nectar and ambrosia gemenas:
his punishment is well known. Pindar mentions his offence, (Olymp. i.
