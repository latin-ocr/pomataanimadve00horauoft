394 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Non ille aut Teucrum aut ipsum violavit Ulixen.---

Veram eqo, ut haerentes adverso litore nave-s· 205
Eriperem, prudens placavi sanquine divos.—

Nempe tuo, furiose—Meo, sed non furiosus.—

Qui species alias veri scelerisque, tumultu

Permixtas, capiet, commotus habebitur; atque

Stultitiane erret, nihilum distabit, an ira. 210
Ajax quum immeritos occidit, desipit, agnos ;

Quum prudens scelus ob titulos admittis inanes,

Stas animo ἓ et purum est vitio tibi, quum tumidum est, cor?
Si quis lectica nitidam gestare amet agnam,
Huic vestem ut gnatae pater, ancillas paret, aurum, 215
Rufam aut Pusillam appellet, fortique marito
Destinet uxorem: interdicto huic omne adimat jus

imprecations against the Atridae.'’—204. Ipsum Ulioeen. “ Ulysses him-
self,” who was the cause of his madness.—-205. Verum eyo, ut haerentes,
&za—Agamemnon speaks, and refers to the well-known story respecting
the sacrifice of his daughter. Adverso litore. “ On an adverse shore.''
-206. Divos. The common account assigns the adverse winds, which
detained the Grecian fleet, to the instrumentality of Diana alone : here,
however, the allusion is not only to Diana, but to the other deities, who
are supposed to have been requested by Diana, and to have aided her in
the accomplishment of her wishes.

208—222. 208. Qui species alias, &c. The construction is as fol-
lowsz—Ille, qui capiet species rerum, alias veri, aliasque sceleris, per.
mixtas tumultu affectuum, habebitur, commotus. “ He who shall form in
mind ideas of things, partly true and partly criminal, confounded toge-
ther amid the tumult of his passions, wiH be regarded as a man of dis-
ordered intellect ;’' i. e. he who, blinded by passion, confounds together
the ideas of things, and mistakes what is crimina] for what is right and
proper, will justly be accounted mad. This definition suits the conduct
of Agamemnon as forcibly as it does that of Ajax. For it will make no
difference, according to the Stoic‚ whether a foolish ambition, or whether
anger, be the impelling cause—210. Stultitiane an ira. Compare the
remark of the scholiast. “ Stultitiane‚ ut tu,· an ira, ut AJaoe.”—212.
Ob titulos inanes,· alluding to the ambitious feelings of Agamemnon,
and to his desire of distinction both with the present age and with poste-
rity.—213. Quam tumidam est. “ When it is swollen with ambition.''
—214. Si quis lectica, &Q The plebeian gives his royal antagonist no
quarter. He has already shown that his folly was criminal, he now
proves that it was ridiculous.—2l5. Aurum. “Golden ornaments.”—
217. Inter-dicto huic omne, &c. ‘⁶ The praetor, by a decree, will deprive
this madman of all control over his property, and the care of it wiu de-
volve on his relations of sound mind.'’ We have here an amusing in-
stance of the license taken by the poet with the “mos Romanus? οἱ
Roman custom of applying to other nations, and to other times, expres-
