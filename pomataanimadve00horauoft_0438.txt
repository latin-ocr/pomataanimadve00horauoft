396 Q. HORATII FLAcc1

Cuique domi esc, id crede tamn, et vel nunc pete, vel cra-3. ·
Accipe, quid contra juvenis responderit aequus :
I η nive Lucana dormis ocream, ut aprum

Coenam eye ,· tupi-sees hiberno ex aequore vellis ; 235

Seynis eqo, indiynus qui tantam possideam .- auser :
Sume tibi decies .- tibi tantundem ; tibi triplex,
Unde umor media currit de nocte vocata.

Filius Aesopi detractam ex aure Metessae,

Scilicet ut decies solidam obsorberet‚ aceto 240

Diluit insignem baccam 3 qui sanior, ac si

Illud idem in rapidum flumen jacerctve cloacam?

Quinti progenies Arri, par nobile fratrum,

Nequitia et nugis, pravorum et amore gemellum,

Luscinias soliti impenso prandere co‘e'mtas. 245

Quorsum abeant? Sani ut creta, an carbone notandi?
Aedificare casas, plostello adjungere mures,

Ludere par impar, equitare in arundine longa,

Si quem delectet barbatum, amentia verset.

—233. Aequus. Ironical.—‘234. In nive Lucana. Lucania was famed
forits wild boare—ocreatus. ‘⁶ Booted.⁷’—237. Sume tibi decies. With
decies supply centena millia sestertium—238. Unde. Equivalent to e
cujus doma—239. Filius Aesopi detractam, &c. We have here a new
instance of prodigality‚ rivalling even that of Nomentanus, in the case of
Clodius, son of the famous tragedian AEsopus. “ The story told of him
by Stertinius will remind us of the one relative to Cleopatra. Pliny,
however, assigns to Clodius the merit of having invented this piece of
extravagance, though Cleopatra surpassed the Roman spendthrist in the
value of the pearl which she dissolved.——Metellue. Who this female was
is unceitain. Some suppose her to be the one of whom Cicero speaks,
Ep. ad Att. xi. ’23- She must have been wealthy, since none but the richest
females were able to wear such expensive ornaments as those to which
the story allides—240. Decies solidam. ‘⁴ A whole million of sesterces-’²
-241, Qui sanior, ac si. “ In what respect less insane, than if.”-
243. Quinti progenies Arri. Compare note on verse 86.—·244. Nequi-
tia et nugis, (xc. ‘⁶ Most closely assimilated to each other in profligacy
and fossy, and in perverted desires.'' Gemellzim is here equivalent to
simillimum, and agrees as an epithet with pan—246. Quorsum abeant?
διο. “ To which clas ss are they to go. ²> Are they to be marked with
chalk as sane, or with charcoal as insane? ⁷' Among the Romans,
white was the lucky colour, black the unlucky. Hence, things of a
·favourable or auspicious nature we1e denoted by 'the former, and those of
an opposite chaxacter by the latter.

247—253. 247. 4edzsicare casas. ‘⁶ To build baby- -lhousae ’—‘248.
Ludere par impar. “To plax at evie 1 nnd odd. —249. timentia verset
