Inachus founded the kingdom of Argos about 1856 B. C. and Codrus was
slain about 1070 B. C. The interval therefore will be 786 years—3.

In order to understand this passage, we must bear in mind, that the pocu-
lum was the goblet out of which each guest drmrk, while the cyathus was
a small measure used for diluting the wine with water, or sor mixing the
two in certain proportions. Twelve of these cyathi went to the sextarius.
Horace, as symposiarch, or master of the feast, issues his edict, which is
well expressed by the imperative form mbcentor, and prescribes the
proportione in which the wine and water are to bc mixed on the present
occasion. For the hard drinkers, therefore, among whom hc classes the
poete, of the twelve cyathi that compose the sextarius, nine will be of
wine and three of water; while for the more temperatam for those who are
friends to the Graces, the proportion on the contrary will be nine cyathi
ofwnbr to three of wine. Iu the numbers here given there is more or less
Rumina to the mystic notions of the day, as both three and nine were held
