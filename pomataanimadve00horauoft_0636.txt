592 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Navibus, aere dato qui pingitur? Amphora coepit
Institui 3 currente rota cur urceus exit 2
Denique sit quidvis, simplex duntaxat et unum.

Maxima pars vatum, pater et juvenes patre digni,
Decipimur specie recti. Brevis esse laboro, 25
Obscurus fio 3 sectantem lenia nervi
Deficiunt animique ; professus grandia turget ;

Serpit humi tutus nimium timidusque procellae ;
Qui variare cupit rem prodigialiter unam,
Delphinum silvis appingit, fiuctibus aprum. 3ο
In vitium ducit culpae fuga, si caret arte.
Aemilium circa ludum faber unus et ungues

21—24, 21. Amphora coepit instiluz'J currente rota cur urceus erit?
A bad poet opens his poem with something great and magnificent, but
amuses himself with trifles. A bad potter begins a large a-nd beautiful
vase, but produces only a worthless pudiea—23. Denique sit quidvis,
simplex duntaxat et unum. ‘¹ In a word, be the object what it may, let
it only be simple and uniform.”——24. Maiima pars vatrtm decipimur
specie recti. The caution already given respecting the observance of
unity, and the avoiding of ill-timed descriptions, is, observes Hurd,
according· to the idea of Horace, the more necessary, as the fault itself
wears the appearance of a virtue, and so writers come to transgress the
rule os right from {heir very ambition to observe it. There are two
cases in which this ambmon remarkably misleads. Thefirst is, when
it tempts us to push an acknowledged beauty too far. (irent beauties
are always on the confines of great faults ; and therefore, by affecting
superior excellence, we are easily carried into what is deserving only
of censure. Thus (from line 25 to 30) brevity often becomes obscurity3
sublimity, bombast5 caulimz, coolness; and a fondness for varying and
‹iive⁷·s{fying a subject by means of episodes and descriptione, such as
are mentioned above (line 15), will osten betray a writer into the
capital error of violating tbe nnity of his piece. For, though variety
be a real excellence under the conduct of true judgment‚ yet when
affected beyond the bounds of probability, and brought in solely to
strike and surprise, it becomes unseasonable and absurd. The second
instance in which we are misled by an ambitium (ff attaining to what is
right, is when, through an excessive sear of committing sauhs, we⁴
disqualify ourselves for the just execution of a whole, or of such par-
ticulars as are susceptible of real beauty. For, not the affectation of
superior excellencies only, but even In citium ducit culpae fuga, si caret
arte.

26—38. 96. Seetantem lenia nervi, διο. Horace is thought by
some to mean himself here—29. Pv-odiyialiter. Happily chosen by
Horace, to carry the mind to that fictitious monster, under which he
had before allusively shadowed out the idea of absurd and inconsistent
compositione—322. Aemilium circa ludamfaber unus, ἄο- “ An uniet,
about the EEmilian school, shall, in a manner superior to all others,
both express the nails, and imitate in brass the easy-flowing hair5 yet
