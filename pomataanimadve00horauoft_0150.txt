'llO Q. HORATII FLACCI

Utrumque sacro digna silentio
Mirantur Umbrae dicere: sed magis 30
Pugnas et exactos tyrannos
Densum humeris bibit aure vulgus.

Quid mirum ’.ἶ ubi illis carminibus stupens
Demittit atras bellua centiceps
Aures, et intorti capillis ’ 35
Eumenidum recreantur angues 3

Quin et Prometheus et Pelopis parens
Dulci laborum decipitur sono:
Nec curat Orion leones
Aut timidos agitare lyncas.

Alcaeus, sounding forth in deeper strains, with thy golden quill, the hard-
ships of ocean, the hardships of exile, the hardships of war.’' Alcaeus, a
native of Mitylene, in the island of Lesbos, was contemporary with Sappho,
Pittacus, and Stesichorus, (Clinton's Fasti Hellmiei, p. 5. 2d. ed.) and
famed as well for his resistance to tyranny and his unsettled life, as for his
lyric productions. Having aided Pittacus to deliver his country from the
tyrants which oppressed it, he quarrelled with this friend, when the people
of Mitylene had placed uncontrolled power in the hands of the latter3 and
some injurious verses which he composed against Pittacus, caused himself
and his adherents to be driven into exile. An endeavour to return by force
of arms pl oved unsucccssful, and Alcaeus fell into the power of his former
friend, who, foigetting all that had passed, generously granted him both life
and freedom. In his odes Alcaeus treated of vaiious topics. At one time
he inveighed against tyrants3 at another, he deplored the misfortunes which
had attended him, and the pains of exile3 while, on other occasions, he
celebrated the praises of Bacchus, and the goddess of love. He wrote in
the Aeolio dialect.

with admiration to each, as they pour forth strains worthy of being
heard in sacred silence.'’ At the ancient sacred rites the most profound
silence was required from all who stood around, both out of respect to
the deity, whom they were worshipping, as also lest some ill· omened
explessi0n‚ casually uttered by any one of the crowd, should mar the
solemnities of the day. Hence the phrase “sacred silence, '’ became
eventually equivalent to, and is herc used “generally as , ‘the deepest
silence ” 30. Sed mayis puyvzas, &c- “But the gathering crowd,
messing with their shouldeis to hear, think in with more delight the
narrative of eonfiicts and of tylants driven from their thrones. '³ The
phrase bibit aure (literally “ ‹lrink in with the ear”) is remarkable
