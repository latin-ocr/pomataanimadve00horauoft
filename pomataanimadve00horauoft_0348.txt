308 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Famosus, multa cum libertate notabant. 5
Hinc omnis pendet Lucilius, hosce secutus,

Mutatis tautum pedibus numerisque, facetus,

Emunctae naris, durus componere versus.

Nam fuit hoc vitiosus, in hora saepe ducentos,

Ul: inagnum, versus dictabat stans pede in uno. 10
Quum flueret, lutulentus, erat quod tollere velles ε
Garrulus, atque piger scribendi ferre laborem,

Scribendi reete: nam ut multum, nil moror. Ecce,
Crispinus minimo me provocat.—-Accipe, si vis,

Accipiam tabulas ; detur nobis Iocus, liora, 15
Custodes ; videamus, uter plus seribere possi&—

Malus. “ A knave.’'——5. Famosus. “ Infamous.”-Multa cum liber-
tate notabant. “Branded him with great freedom.”—6. Hinc omnis
pendet Lucilius ,· literali), “from this Lucilius entirely hange ; '' i. e.
this freedom of satire was also the great characteristic of Lucilius. Luci-
lius was a Roman knight, born A. U. C. 505, at Suessa. a town in the
Auruncan territory. He was desc-ended of a good family, and was grand-
uncle by the mother's side to Pompey the Grcat. His chief characteristic
was his vchenient and cutting satire. Macrobius (Saturn. iii. 16) calls him
‘⁴ Acer et violentus poEta.'’—·7. Mutatis lantum pedibus numerisque,
διο. “ Having changed merely the feet and the rhythin of his verse.’'
This applies to the greater part, not however to all, of his Satires. Tho
Greek eomic writers, like the tragic, wrote in iambic verse (trimeters):
Lucilius, on the other hand, adopted the hexameter versification in twenty
books of his Satires, from the commcncemcnt; while in the rest, with the
exception of the thirtieth, hc employed iauibics or trochaics.—-8. Emunclae
naris, durus componere versus. “ Of nice disccrnment, though harsh
in the structure of his lineS.”—lO. Ut magstrum. ‘⁸ As if it were a
great feat.'’ Compare the explanation of the scholiast: ‘⁴ Tanquam rem
maynam et laude diynam.''--Stans pede inuno. ³‘ standing on ono
foot.” This, of course, must bc taken in a figurative- sense, and is'intended
merely to signify “in a very short time.’' Horace satirises Lucilius for his
hurried eopiousness and sacility.—ll. Quumflue7·et lutulentus, ἕω. “As
he flowcd aiuddily along, there was always something that one would feci
inclined to throw away ;''
Horace compares the whole poetry of Lucilius to a muddy and troublcd
stream, eontinually bearing impurities on its surfacc that one would feel
inclined to remove.

12—21 . 12. Sci-iheum· laborem. By this is meant in fact tho labour
of correction, as the poet himself immediately after adds—13. Scrilaendi
recte, Sec. ‘⁶ Ι mean of writing correctly, for, as to how much he wrote,
I do not at all concern. myself about that? Lucilius was a very volu-
minous mitem—Ecce. Crispinus ‘minimo me provocat. Uuderstand
nummo. ΜΞΝ, Crispinus challenges nie in the smallcst sum I ehoose
to name.'’ The meaning is, that Crispinus offers to bet a large sum, so
certain is he of victory, against the smalicst sum the poet feels inclined

i. e. to take up and cast asido as worthloss. .
