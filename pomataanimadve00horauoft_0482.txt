Summus ego, et prope me Viscus Thurinus, et infra, 20

justly calls these ‘⁶ divitias miseras.''-—Una. Understand tecum—19.
Nosse laboro. “I am impatient to k11ow.”—‘20. Summus eyo. “I
was first on the highest couch.” In the absence of a ffiagram, the
same mode of explanation will be here adopted which has already been
resorted to. Consult note on Sat. 1. iv. 87. If the present page be
imagined a square, the top and two sides will represent the parts of a
Roman table along which the three couches were placed. The couch
on the right hand was called summus lectus ,· the one placed along the
side supposed to correspond with the top of the page, was called medius
lectus ,· while the remaining conch on the left was tenned imus lectus.
Each of these couches held three persons, and the post of honour on
each was the central place ; the guests who occupied the middle of each
of the three couches being styled respectively‚ primus summi lecti,
primus medii lecti, primus imi lecti. The most honourable of these three
places, and consequently of the whole entertainment, was the primus
medii lecti, and here, 011 the present occasion, was the post of Maecenas.
The arrangement of the whole party then will be as follows: On the
summus lectus will be placed Viscus Thurinus, Fundanius, and Varius,
the first of these occupying the part of the couch nearest the bottom
of the table (i. e. the bottom of the page), the second the centre, which
makes him primus summi lecti, or, as it is expressed in the text,
summus, and the third the part nearest the top of the table (i. e. the top
of the page). On the medius lectus, the individual nearest the lower
extremity of the summus lectus will be Servilius Balatro, in the middle
will recline Maecenas, and below him (2'. e. nearest the imus lectus, or
left side of the present page) will be Vibidius. On the imus lectus the
arrangement will be Nomentanus, Nasidienus, and Porcius 3 the first of
these reclining on the upper palt of the conch, Nasidienus occupying
the middle, and Porcius being the lowest guest of all. It must be borne
in mind, that those who recline on the summus lectus have their bodies
extended upwards along the couch in· a diagonal direction, and those on
tho imus lectus downwards, while the guests on the medius lectus recline
with their heads towards the summus lectus. ⁴ .
22—30. 22. Umbras. “ As uninvited guests.” Among the Ro-
mans, persons of distinction, when invited to an entertainment, had
liberty to bring with them unbidden guests, who were styled umbrae.
The umbrae brought on this occasion by Maecenas were two buffoons
(scurrae).—‘24. Ridiculus totas simul, ἃς. “ Who made himselfridicu-
lons by swallowing whole cakes at once.” Porcius was a parasite of
their entertainer.-‘25. Nomentanusad hoc, &c. Nomentanus was
present for this purpose, in order that if any thing should chance to
escape the observation of the guests, he might point it out with his fore-
