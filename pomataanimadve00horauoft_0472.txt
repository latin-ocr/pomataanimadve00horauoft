43⁸) Q. IIORATII FLACCI

Cum tribus annellis, modo laeva Priscus inani.

Vixit inaequalis, clavum ut mutaret in horas ; lo
Aedibus ex magnis subito se conderet, unde

Mundior exiret vix libertinus honeste :

Jam moechus Romae, jam mallet doctor Athenis

Vivere : Vertumnis, quotquot sunt, natus iniquis.

Scurra Volanerius, postquam illi justa cheragra 15
Contudit articulos, qui pro se tolleret atque

Mitteret in phimum talos, mercede diurna

Conductum pavit: quanto constantior idem

In vitiis, tanto levius miser ac prior illo,

Qui jam contento, jani laxo fune laborat. ’20

10—14. 10. Vixit inaequalis. “ He led an inconsistent lise.” “ Nil
aequale homini suit illi.”—Clavzmz ut nzut‘m‘et in horas. ‘⁶ So as to change
his clavus every hour 3¹⁸ 1. e. so as to appear one moment in the latus
clavus of a senator, and at another in the angla-stus clavus of an eques.
From this it would follow, that Priscus, if lie had indeed any real exist-
enee, was a member of the equestrian order, and of senatorian rank.—
ll. Aedibus etv maynis subito se conderet, ᾃο. “ From a splendid man-
sion he would on a sudden hide himself in a place, from which a decent
freedman could hardly with propriety come out.” 111* zmdz'or literally
means one a little more attentive than ordinary to the decencies and
proprieties of life, and hence mundior libertinus denotes one of the more
decent class of freedmen‚ and who is raised above the ordinary level.-
14. Vertumnis, quotquot sunt, natus iniquis. “ Boru beneath the anger
of the Vertumni, as many as the1e are.'' Vertumnus was an ancient
deity of the Etrurians, whose worship was brought to Rome. He pos-
sessed, like the Grecian Proteus, the power of transforming himself into
any shape or form at pleasure, an attribute which the plural nameis here
purposely used to express, 35 if each new shape were 3. separate Ver-
tumnus. Hence the meaning here intended to be conveyed is as follows:
that when Priscus was born, Vertumnus, in anger, gave him a changing,
fiekle, and inconstant disposition.

15—26. 15. Justa. ‘⁶ Well-meritecl ;” i. e. the just punishment
of his intemperance,-16. Contudit. ‘⁶ Had erippled.”-—l7. Phimum.
“ The box” into which the tali or tesserae were cast from another called
the fritillas, and out of which they were then thrown upon the gaming- ’
board or table, was styled phimns.-Tal0s. The tali here meant are
those described in the note on Ode 11. vii. v25. For the other kind, con-
sult note on Sat. 11. iii. 171.-18. Pavit. ‘⁶ Maintained‚” or “kept.''
-19. Tanto levius miser ac prior illo, &a “ By 50 much less wretched,
and better off, than the other, who, one while, struggles with a tight,
another, with a loosened cord 3³⁹ i. e. who one moment struggles with
his passions, and the next instant yields to their violence.—2l. Hodie ;
equivalent here to statim—Haeo tam putida. ‘⁶ Such tedicus tmsh.'’——
