366 Q. HORATII FLACCI

HORATIUS.

Quid? quum est Lucilius ausus
Primus in hunc operis componere carmina morem,
Detrahere et pellem, nitidus qua quisque per ora
Cederet, introrsum turpis; num Laelius, aut qui 65
Duxit ab oppressa meritum Carthagine nomen,
Ingenio offensi? aut laeso doluere Metello,
Famosisque Lupo cooperto versibus? Atqui
Primores populi arripuit, populumque tributim;
Scilicet uni aequus virtuti atque ejus amicis. 70
Quin ubi se a vulgo et scena in secreta remorant
Virtus Scipiadae et mitis sapientia Laeli,
Nugari cum illo et discincti ludere, donec

the whole reply of Trebatius is as follows: Yes, yes, my good friend, it
would be very well if even exile alone were involved in this matter·
But there is something worse connected with it. At present, all is fair;
thou livest at Rome in the society of the great and powefful, and they
smile on thee, because thou amusest them. But where is thy safety?
In an unguarded moment, those very powers of satire, which they now
laud to the skies, will be directed against some one of their own number:
Coldness and aversion will succeed‚ on their part, to intimate and fami-
liar friendship, and thou, unable to bear the change, wilt pine away in
vexation and grief, until death closes the scene.

more freely‚ “to remove the mask.”-Per ora cederet. “Moved proudly
before the faces of men-'⁹ Cederet is for incederem—65. Qui dua-it ab
oppressa, ἃς. ; auuding to the younger Africanus—67. Inyem'o. “By
his satirical vein.”——Il{etello. The reference is to Metellus Macedonicus,
who, as a politieal opponent of Scipio⁹s, was of course satirized by
Lucilius.-—68. Lupo. The allusion is to Rutilius Lupus, a considerable
man in the Roman state, but noted for his wickedness and impiety.
Lucilius, in one of his books of satires, represents an assembly of the
gods deliberating on human affm'rs, and, in particular, discussing what
punishment ought to be inflicted on hini—69. Arripuit. “He attack-
ed.''—Tributim. “Tribe after tribe.'' Not content with lashing the
patricians, he ran through all the thirty-five tribes, one after another,
every where selecting, with an impartial hand, those whose vices or
failings made them the legitimate objects of satire.—70. Scilicet uni
aequas virtuti, διο. “ In short, sparing virtue alone and virtue's friends.”
-7l. Quin ubi se a valeo, διε. “And yet, when the brave Scipio and
the mild and wise Laelius had withdrawn themselves from the crowd and
the scene of public life to the privacy of home, they were accustomed to
trifle and diveit themselves with him, free from all restraint, while the
herbs were cooking for their supper.''—7‘2. Virtus Scipiadae et mitis
sapientia Laeli. An imitation of the Greek idiom, for sortis Scipio et
mitis atque sapiens Laelius.—73. Dedere. The scholiast relates the
