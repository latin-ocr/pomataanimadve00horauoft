,518 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Vir bonus, omne forum quem spectat et omne tribunal,
Quandoounque deos vel porco vel bove placat,
Jane pater, clare, clare quum dixit Apollo,
Labra movet metuens audiri z Pulchra Lauerna, 60
Da milei fallere, da justo scmctoque videri ,-
Noctem peccatis, et finudz'bzcs objice nubem.
Qui melior servo, qui liberior sit avarus,
In triviis fixum quum se demittit ob assem,
Non video. Nam qui cupiet, metuet quoque; porro 65
Qui metuens vivet, liber mihi non erit unquam.
Perdidit arma, locum virtutis deseruit, qui
Semper in augenda festinat et obruitur re.
Vendere quum possis, captivum, occidere noli ;

true, is in this case less, but not thy villany.'' The poet here toucheS,
as it would appear, upon the doctrine of the Stoics, respecting the essen-
tial nature of crime-57. Vir bonas, omne forum, &e Horace here
introduces another vice, common to those who falsely affect a character
of virtue—they want also to deceive the world by putting on an exterior
of devotion. They go to the temple, offer sacrifices, and pray so as to
be heard by au. When they have prayed to gain the good opinion of
the public, they mutter their secret wishes for the success of their
villanies and hypocrisy. It is not the poet's design to censure either
private or public prayer, but the abuse of it ; and the vir bonus here inm
troduced to our notice, is, like the one that has preceded him, merely
entitled to this appellation in the opinion of the vulgar, who are governed
entirely by external circumstances—59. -Jcme pater. To Janus not
only the opening of the year was consecrated, but also that of the day,
and he was of course invoked to aid the various un'dertakings in which
men engaged—60. Pulchra Lauerna. Lavema, in the strange mytho-
logy of the Romam, was the goddess of fraudulent men and of thieves.—

63—7‘2. 63. Qui melior servo, ἃς. In this latter part of his epistle
the poet shows, that there is no servitude equal to that which our pas-
sions impose upon us- Men of a covetous temper stoop to the meanest
arts of acquiring wealth. Horace justly compares them to that sordid
class of beings, who descended so low as to stoop to take up a piece of
false money, nailed to the ground by children on purpose to deceive
those who passed by.-—67. Perdidit arma, locum virtutis deseruit, ἃς.
“ The man who is perpetually busy and immersed in the inereasing of
his wealth, has thr-own away his arnw, has abandoned the post of
virtuess' By arma are here meant the precepts of virtue and wisdom.
The poet draws a noble and beautiful idea of life, The deity has sent
us into this world to combat vice⁷ and maintain a constant warfare
against our passionS. The man who gives ground is like the coward that
has thrown away liis arim, and abandoned the post it was his duty to
preserve.—69. Captivum. “This captive.⁷' The avaricious and sordid
man is here ironically styled a captive, because a complete slave to his
