CARMINUM Lm. 11, 17. 117

obire, Maecenas, mearum
Grande decus columenque rerum.

Ah ! te meac si partem animae rapit 5
M aturior vis, quid moror altera 2
Nec carus aeque, nec superstes
Integer. Ille dies utramque

Ducet ruinam. Non ego perfidum
Dixi sacramentum: ibimus, ibimus, 10
Utcunque praecedes, supremum
Carpere iter comites parati.

One XV11.—Addressed to Maecenas, languishing under a protracted
aud painful malady‚ and expecting every moment a termination of his
existence. The poet seeks to call off the thoughts of his patron and
friend from so painful a subject3 and, while he descants in strong and
feeling language on the since-rity of his own attachment, and on his
resolve to accompany him to the grave, he seeks at the same time to
inspiro him with brighter hopes, and with the prospectos rccovery from the
haud of disease.

The constitution of Maecenas, naturally weak, had been impaired by
effeminaey and luxurious living. ‘⁴ Hc had laboured‚'' observes Mr.
Dunlop, “ from his youth under a perpetual sever-3 and for many years
before his death he suffered much from watchfulness, which was greatly
aggravated by his domestic chagrins. Maecenas was fond of life and
enjoyment3 and of life even without enjoyment. He confessos, in some
verses preserved by Seneca, that he would wish to live even under every
accumulation of physical calamity. (Seneca, Epist. 101.) Hence he
anxiously resorted to different remedies for the cure or relies of this dis-
tressing malady. iVine, soft music sounding at a distance, and various
other coutrivances, were tried in vain. At length Antonius Musa, the
imperial physieian, obtained for him some alleviation of his complaint by
means of the distant murmuring of falling-water. But all these resources
at last failed. The nervous and severish disorder with which he was
affiicted increased so dreadfully, that for three years before his death he
{ever clased his eyes.” (Hi-story of Roman Literature‚ vol. iii. p. 42.
