284 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Sed tamen amoto quaeramus seria ludo,

Ille gravem duro terram qui vertit aratro,

Perfidus hic cautor, miles, nautaeque, per omne
Audaces mare qui currunt, hac mente laborem 30
Sese ferre, senes ut in otia tuta recedant,

Aiunt, quum sibi sint congesta cibaria 3 sicut

Parvula (nam exemplo est) magni formica laboris

Ore trahit quodcunque potest, atque addit acerVO,

Quae, simul inversum contristat Aquarius annum,

Non usquam prorepit, et illis utitur ante

Quaesitis sapiens : quum te neque fervidus aestus
Demoveat lucro, neque hiems, ignis, mare, ferrum 3

Nil obstet tibi, dum ne sit te ditior alter. 40
Quid juvat immensum te argenti pondus et auri

Furtim defossa timidum deponere terra 2—

Sed tamen. ‘¹ However.” These particles, as well as the simple, sed,

“ The little ant of great industry.'' The epithets parvula and ‘magni
present a very pleasing antithesis.-35. Haud iynara ac non incauta
saturi. ‘⁶ Not ignorant nor improvident of the future.’'—36. Simul
inversum contristat, &c. “As soon as Aquarius saddens the ended
year‚'’ The year is here considered as a circle constantly turning round
and renewing its course. Hence the epithet inversus, (inverted, ι’. e.
brought to a close,) which is applied to it when one revolution is fully
ended and another is just going to commence. The allusion in the text is
to the beginning of winter. According to Porphyrion, the sun passed into
Aquarius on the 17th day before the Calends of February, (16th January‚)
and stoi-ms of rain and severe cold marked the whole period of its continu-
ance in that sign of .the &diam—37. Et illis utitur ante, διο. “And
wisely uses those stores which it has previously collected.’' The ant
shows more wisdom than the miser, in using, not hoarding up, its gathered
stores.

38—56. 38. Neque fervidus aestus, διε. The allusion is here to
things violent in themselves, and which every moment threaten injury
or destruction. ⁴‘ Neither the scorching heat of summer, nor the win-
ter’s cold, fire, shipwreck, or the swortl.’'—-40. Dum. ‘⁴ Provided.’'—
