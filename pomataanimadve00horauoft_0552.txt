510 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Musa supervacuas Antonius, et tamen illis

Me facit invisum, gelida quum perluor unda

Per medium frigus. Sane myrteta relinqui, 5
Dictaque cessantem nervis elidere morbum

Sulfura contemni, vicus gemit, invidus aegris,

Qui caput et stomachum supponere fontibus audent
Clusinis, Gabiosque petunt- et frigida rura.

Mutandus locus est, et deversoria nota 10
Praeteragendus equus. Quo tendis ,9 von mihi Cumas

Antonius Musa thinks, that Baiae is of no service to me ;'‘ i. e. that
I can derive no benefit from the warm baths at Baiae.-3. illusa Anto-
nius. As regards the celebrated cure performed by this physician on
Augustus, which proved the foundation of his fame, compare the account
of the scholiast. He recommended the cold bath to Horace also for the
weakness in his eyes—Et tamen illis me facit invisum, &c. ‘⁶ And yet
makes me odious to that place, when I am going to be bathed in cold
water, in the depth of winter ;” τ’. e. and yet makes the people of that
place highly incensed against me, when they see me about to use the
cold bath in mid-winter. Pffl‘luor, as here employed, does not suppose
that the poet had already used the cold bath, but that he was on the
point of doing so. It is equivalent‚ therefore, to cum in eo sum ut per-
lzcar. The supposed anger of the people of Baiae arises from seeing
their warm baths slighted, and their prospects of gain threatened with
diminution.

5-9, 5. lllyrteta. Referring to the myrtle-groves of Balsa—6.
Cessantem morbum. This morbus cessans (“ lingering disease'')⁶ is
caused, observes Sanadon, by a phlegmatic humour, which, obstructing
the nerves‚ produces a languid heariness, and sometimes deprives the
part affected of all sensation and action, as in palsies and apoplexia.—
Elz'dere. “ To drive away ;'’ literally, ‘⁵ to dash ou't.'’ The term
strikingly depicts the rapidity of the cure.-7. &alfara—‘⁶ Their sul-
phur-baths.” The allusion is to the vapour-baths of Baiae.-—Invidus
aeyrz's. ‘⁶ Bearing no good-will to these invalids.''—8. Qui caput et
stomachum, διο. The allusion here would seem ‘to be to a species of
shower-baths.—9. Clusinis. Clusium was a city of Etruria, nearly on
a line with Perusia, and to the west of it. It is now Clausi—Gabios-
que. Consult 2note on Epist. 1. xi. 7.—Friy²'da. Cold because moun-
tainous. .

10-25. 10. Mutandus Iocus est, διε. The idea intended to be con-
veyed is this : 1 must obey my physician, I must change my baths, and
go no more to Baiae. The poet now humorously supposes himself on
the point of setting out. If perchance, observes he, my horse shall
refuse to turn away from the road leading to Cumae or to Baiae, and to
leave his usual stages, Ι, his rider, will chide him for his obstinaey,
angrily pulling in the left—hand rein: but horses hear not words, their
ear is in the bin—Deversoria nota praeterayendus. An anastrophe, for
ayendus praeter deuersoria noim—ll. Cumas. Cumae was an ancient
city of Campania, placed on a rocky hill washed by the sea, and situate
