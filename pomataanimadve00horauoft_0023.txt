or MAECENAS. xix

be carried tom the house of Maecenas 3—-so difficule was it to find
repose in the habitation os a prinee l

During the most important and arduous periods of his administra-
tion, and while exercising an almost unremitting assiduity, Maecenas
had still the appearance of being sunk in sloth and luxury. Though
he could exert himself with the utmost activity and vigilance, when
these were required, yet, in his hom-s of freedom, he indulged him·
sels in as much ease and softness as the mest delicate lady in Rome&
He was moderate in his desires of wealth or honours 3 he was proba-
blyindolent and voluptuous by nature and inclination ; and he rather
wished to exhibit than conceal his faults. The air of effeminate
ease which he ever assumed, was perhaps good policy in reference
both to the prinee and people. Neither could bc jealous of a minis-
ter who was apparently so careless and indifferent, and who seemed
occupied chiefly with his macrnifieent villas and costly surniture. He
usually came abroad with a newliffent vait, and in a loose garb„
When he went to the Theatre, Forum, or senato, his ungirt robe
trailed on the ground, and he wore a little eloah, “'inQhOO‘L like a
fugitive slave in a pantomime. Instead of being followed by lictors,
or tribunes, he appeared in all public places attended bytwo eunuchs†.
He possessed a magnificent and spacious villa 011 the Es uiline Hill,
to which a tower adeed rema-fizable sor its height. The gardent}
of Maecenas, which suri-eunded the villa, were among the most de-
lightful in Rome or its vicinityss. H-Qe, seated in the cool shade of
his green spreading trees, whence the most musical birds constantly
wax-bled their harmonious notes, he was accustomed ‘to linger, and
pay at idle hours his court to the Muses¹

 

Being fond of change and singularity, the style of Maecenas’s en-
tertainments varied. They were sometimes profuse and magnificent,
at others elegant and private ; but they were always inimitable in
point of taste and fancy. He was the first person who introduced at
Rome the luxury of young mnle’s flesh ᾗ ; his table was served with
the most delicious wines, among which was one os Italian growth,
and most exquisite flavour, called from his namQ-Ige—cggzatiagfflnjl ‚·
and hence, too, the luxui-iens Trimalchio, who is the Mdffisse'tcr Con-
viviz‘ in the “ Satyricon'’ of Petronius Arbiter, is called Maecenatia-
nus, from his imitating the style of Maecenas’s entertainments.

His sumptuous board was thronged with parasites, whom he also
frequently carried about to sup with his friendsffi and his house was
filled by musicianS, buffoons, and actors of mimes, or pantomimes,
with Bathyllus at their head. These were strangely intermingled in
his palace with tribunes clerk-s, and lictors. But there, too, were
