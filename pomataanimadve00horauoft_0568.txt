526 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Derisor lecti, sic nutum divitis horret,

Sic iterat voces, et verba cadentia tollit,

Ut puerum saevo credas dictata magistro

Reddere, vel partes mimum tractare secundas:

Alter rixatur de lana saepe caprina, et 15

Propugnat nugis armatus3 scilicet, ut non

Sit milei prima fides, et vere quod placet ut non

Acriter elatrem, pretium aetas altera sordet.

Ambigitur quid enim? Castor sciat an Dolichos plus 3

Brundisium Minuci melius via ducat, an Appi. 20
Quem damnosa Venus, quem praeceps alea nudat,

obsequious fawning, and a buffoon of the lowest 0011011 ;” i. e. carrying
his obsequious complaisance to exeess, and degenerating into a. mere
buffoon. The expression imi derisor lecti has been much misunderstood.
In order to comprehend its true meaning, we must bear in mind that
the buffoons or jesters at a Roman entertainment were placed on the
lowest couch along with the entertainer3 (consult note on Sat. 11. viii. 403)
and hence derisor imi lecti does not by any means imply, as some sup-
pose, a rallier of those who recline on the lowest 0011011, but is merely
intended as a general designation for the buffoon or jester of the party.
Horace advances a general proposition, and, to make flatterers appear
the more odious, he says very judiciously, that in pushing their com-
plaisance too far, they degenerate into mere buffoons.—ll. ,Sic ‘rt-utum
divitis horret. ‘¹ Is so fearfully attentive to every nod of his patron.''
—14. Reddere; equivalent to recitare. “ As regards the term Dictata
consult note on Sat. 1. x. 75.-Minum. ‘⁶ A 11111110 player.” Consult
note on Sat. 1. x. 6.

15—20. 15. Alter rixatur de lana saepe caprina. “The other osten
wrangles about things of 110 consequence whatever.” Alter here refers
to the man of rude and blunt manners. The expression de lana caprina
rixari is a proverbial 0110, and is well explained by the scholiast ι “ De
lana caprina: proverbium, hs. e. de re vili et paene nulla ,· de nihilo, quia
caprae nulla est lana, sed pili.”-16. Propugnut nugis armatus. “ Armed
’ with trifles, stands forth a ready champion ;'' i. e. armed with mere
trifles and nonsense‚ he combats every thing that 15 advanced.-Scilicet.
“ For example.” The poet now gives a specimen of that zealous con-
tention for trifles which marks the character that is here condemned.
-17. Et vere quod placet ut non acriter elato-em. “ And that I should
not boldly speak aloud what are my real sentiments.”—18. Pretium
aetas altera sordet. “ Another life is worthless‚ when purchased at
such a price ;’' i. e. I would reject with scom another life upon such
base conditions.—l9. Ambigitur quid enim? “And pray what mighty
matter is in dispute Ρ Why, whether Castor or Dolichos knows more of
his profession ;'' i. e. whether Castor or Dolichos be the more expert
gladiator. Compare the scholiast ι “ Castor et Dolichos erant illius tem-
poris nobiles gladiatores.”—20. Minuci via. Compare t'ne scholiasta:
‘⁶ Minucia via est a porta Minucia, sive Trigemina‚ per Sabinos ad Brun-
‹tisiam-'²
