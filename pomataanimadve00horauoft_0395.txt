SERMONUM L113. 1. lO. 355

In silvam uon liynaftras insanius, ac εἰ

Turgidus Alpinus jugulat dum Memnona, dumque

Defingit Rheni luteum caput. : haec ego ludo,

Quae neque in aede sonent certantia judice Tarpa,

Nec redeant iterum atque iterum spectanda theatris.

in obliging his descendants not to cultivate any language but their own·
--33. Quum somnia vera. It was a common belief among the ancient&
that dreams after midnight, and towards morning, were trum—34. In
silvam non liqna serm, ἀς. The proverbial form of expression “in
sileam liyna serre,’' to denote a useless and superfluous effort, is analo-
gous to the common English oue, ‘⁸ To carry coal to Neu-casile?—
Insanias. ‘⁶ With more folly.’'—36. Turyidus Alpinus jztyulat, &c.
The allusion is to a wretched poet, named Alpinus, who, in descn‘bing
Memnon elain by Achilles, kills him, as it were, a second time, by the
misci-able character of his description—Dumque definyit Rheni luteum
caput. ‘⁴ And while, with inventive genius, he describes the muddy
fountain-head of the Rhine.'' 'We have here an ironical allusion to another
laughable seat of the same poet, in giving to the Rhine a head of mud-
Definyo does not merely mean ‘⁶ to dcscribe‚'' but cariies with it also tho
idea of invention or fiction. In the present case the invention or fiction is
all the poct’s own—38. In aede. “ In some temple.'’ The allusion is
to the Roman custom of compelling the dramatic poets to read ovcr their
pieres before some person or persons, appointed bytho aediles to decide
upon the merits of their compositions. The successful pic-ce was repre-
sentcd on thc stage. A temple was usually selected for this pu1])ose.—
Certanlia judice Tarpa. “ Contending for the prize‚ with Tarpa as the
judge.” Compare the account given by the scholiast, who is wrong,
however, in what he states respecting the temple of Apollo. Compare also
preceding note: ‘⁴ Metius (or Iliaecius) Tarpa suit judea· criticus,
auditor assiduus poematum et po'e‘tarum, in aede Apollinis seu
Asusarum, quo convenire potitae solebant, suaque scripta recitare,
quae nisi Tarpa aut alio critico probarentur, in scenam non desere-
bantur.”—39. Nec redeant iterum, &cu The construction is, Nec
redeant theatris, iterum atque iterum spectanda.

40—44. 40. Arguta meretrice potes, &m “Thou‚ Fundanius,
alone of all men living, dost possess the talent of prattling forth tales in a
spcrtivc vein, where an artful courtesan and a Davus impose upon an old
Chremes.” The allusion is to comcdy. in which, according to the account
here given by Horace, Fundanius appears to have been distinguished,
though πολεων nothing of hini from the testimony of other writers.
The characters introduced into the text have reference to one of the plays
of Terence, but arc intended also to be general in their application to
comic mining.--Davo. Davus is the name of a wily slave in Terence.
-42, Pollia. The poet refers to C. Asinius Pollio, whose acquircmcnts
enablcd him tc chine in the noblest branches of polite literature, poetry,
