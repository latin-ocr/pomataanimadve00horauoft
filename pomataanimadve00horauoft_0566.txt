524 Q,- HORATII FLACCI

I ndotata mihi soror est, paupercula mater,

Et fundus nec vendibilis nec pascere firmus,

Qui dicit, clamat: Victum (late. Succinit alter,

Et mihi dividuo findetur munere quadra.

Sed tacitus pasci si posset corvus, haberet 553
Plus dapis et rixae multo minus invidiaeque,

Brundisium comes aut Surrentum ductus amoenum,

Qui queritur salebras et acerbum frigus et imbres,

Aut cistam effractam aut subducta viatica plorat,

Nota refert meretricis acumina, saepe catellam, 55
Saepe periscelidem raptam sibi flentis : uti mox

Nulla fides damnis verisque doloribus adsit.

Nec semel irrisus triviis attollere curat

Fracto crure planum ; licet illi plurima manet

the source of all.” The imperfect, as here employed, does not accord
with the usage of our own language, and must therefore be rendered
by the present. In the original, however, it gives a very pleasing air to
the clause,as marking a continuance of action in the two particular cases to
which he refers. The poet intends to convey the following idea: The
man who wishes to obtain a favour at the hands of the great and power-
ful, should, above all things, display a modest deportment, and one far
removed from importunate solicitation.--46. indotata mihi soror est, &a
‘⁴ The man who tells his patron, ‘ My sister has no portion, my mother
is in straitened circumstances, and my farm is neither saleable nor to be
relied upon for my support,' eries out, in effect, Give me food.''—48.
Succinit alter, et mihi dividuo, διο. “ Another responds, A quarter shall
be cut out for me too from the divided gift.” An imitation of the cry of
mendicants in asking charity. Quadra is properly a piece of bread or
mke cut in the form of a quarter.—50. Sed tacitus pasci si posset corvus,
«Sne. The poet compares the cries made by the raven when fighting on
food to the clamours of the importnnate.

52—55. 52. Surrentum3 a city of Campania, on the Sinus Crater,
or Bay of Naples‚ and not far from the Promontorium Minervae, now
Sameram—Brundisium comes aut Surrentum ductus amoenum, &c. ‘⁶ He
who, when taken as a companion by his patron either to Brundisium
or the delightful Surrentum, complains,” &rc—55. Nota refert meretricis
acumina, &c. “ Resembles the well-known tricks of a harlot, often
weeping for a bracelet, often for a garter sorcibly taken from her ς so
that in time no credit is given to her real losses and griefs ;” i. e. prac-
tises the known deceptions of a harlot, ἃς. By the term catella (for
mtenula) is here meant a small chain, which ferna-les commonly wore
upon their wrists by way of bracelets. Pensa-elis, which we have here
rendered “ garter‚'' would seem to have been a species of ornament
passing round the leg, and meeting the straps which secured the sandal
on the foot. The word is of Greek origin, περισκελὶς.

58—62. 58. Nec semel irrisus, ἃς. “ Nor will he who has once
been imposed upon,'’ &e.-59. Fracto crure planum. “A vagabond
