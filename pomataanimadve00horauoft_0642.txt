ation is more rapid, :nd this rapidity forms, according to Aristode, a
greater number of sharp sounds. Dacier adds. that the iambic, being
less different from common conversation, more easily engaged the
attention of an audience.— 83. Fidi( “ 'l'o the lyte.''—84. Ee

am Ι greeted with the name of poet, if Ι am unable, and in fact know
not how, to observe the distinctions that have just been mentioned, and
the different characters that productions should have in the different
species of verse ?’' As regards the connexion in the train of ideas,
compare the remarks of Hurd z ‘¹ But the distinction of the mensures
to be observed in the several species of poetry‚ is so obvious, that there
can scarcely be any mistake about them. The difficulty is to know
(from line 86 to 89) how far each may partake ofthe spirit of the other
without destroying that mutual and necessary difference which ought to
subsist between them all. To explain this, which is a point of great

is one of the most tragic nature. Hurd, however, assigns another
and very ingenious explanation. “ We may be sure,” observes this
critic, “that the subject in question was not taken up at random as
the representative of the rest. The reason was, that the Thyestes of
Ennius was peculiarly chargeable with the fault here censured. This
allusion to a particular play, written by one of their best poets, and
