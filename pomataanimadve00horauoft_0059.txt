of maidens, briskly assailing with pared nails their yonthful admirers.”—

the idea of a serious contest.

One VIL-——Addressed to L. Munatius Plancus, who had become
suspected by Augustus of disaffection, and meditated, in consequence,
· ‘retffing from Italy to some one of the Grecian cities. As far as can
b?'eonjectured from tho present ode, Plall'cussssad communicated his
intention to Horace, and the poet now sEek‘s “to'‘ dissuade him from the
stcp3 bnt in such a way, however, as not to endanger Eis own standing
with the emperor. The train of thought appears to be as follows: “ I
leave it to others to celebrate. the far—famed cities and regions of the
rest of the world: My admiration is wholly engrossed by the beautiful
scenery around the banks and falls of the Anio.'' (Hc here refrains from
adding, “Betake yourself, Plancus, ·to that lqng-ys ot,'' but merely
subjoins τ) ‘¹' The south wind, my friend, does not :sse-{ys vcil the sky

wherever you may dwell, chase away the cares of life with mellow
wine, taking Teucer as an example of patient endurance worthy of all
imitation.’' “

l. Laudabunt alii. “Others are wont to praise.'' This peculiar
usage of the future is in imitation of a Greek idiom, of no unfrequcnt
occurrence: thus ἀτιμήσουσι (Hes. Ἔργα καὶ Ἡμέραι, 185.) for ἀτιμᾷν
φιλοῦσι, and μέμψονται (ἰεί. ibid. 186.) for μέμφεσθαι φιλοῦσι. For

other examples‚ compare Graevius, Lect. Hes. 5. and Matthiae, G. G.

Claram Rhodon. ⁴⁴ The sunny Rhodes.’' The epithet claram is here
commonly rendered by “ il'lnsm'ous‚” which weakens the force of the line
by its generality, and is decidedly at variance with the well-known skill
displayed by Homce in the selection of his epithets. The interpretation
which we have assigned to the word, is in full accordance with a passage of
Lucan ε (viii. 248. ‘· Clarumque reliquit sole Rhodon.’‘ Pliny ⁷
(Hist. Nat. ii. 62. informs us of a boast on the partos the Rhodians‘ that
