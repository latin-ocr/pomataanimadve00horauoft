25—26. 25. Jacentem regnam. ‘⁸ Her palace plunged in afflietion.”
-26. Fortis et asperas, ἃῖ. “ And had courage to handle the exaspe-
rated serpents.'' Horace herc adopts the common opinion of Cleopatra’s
death having been occasioned by the bite of an asp, the animal having
been previously irritated b) the queen ivith a goldenffl bodkin. There is a
great deal of doubt² however, on this subject, as may be seen from Plu-

tarch’s statement. Aftei mentioning the common account, which we have

 

just given, the biographer remarks. ‘⁵ lt was likewise 1e orted that she
carried about with hei celtain poison in a hollow bodk' 1u which she wore

in her hair; yet theie was ιιδῖἧὲι* any mark of poison οἶ] her body, nor
was there any serpent found in the monument, though the track' of a
reptile was said to have been discovered on the sea-sande opposue the
windows of her apartment. Others again have affirmed, that she had two

 

sunall puuctures on her arm, apparently occasioned by the as ’s sting3 aud
to this Caesar obviously gave credit3fo1 her effigy, which lie carried in

triumphs had an asp on the arm. ’³ It is more th tn piobable thar the asp
” on the arm (Πῆῖέἕῆξγ was a mere ornament mistaken by the populace
for a sy mbolical allusion to ilie manner of Cleopatra' s death. Or we may
conclude with lVrangham, that there would of course be au asp on the
diadem of the effigy, because it was peculiar to she kings of Egypt.
29—32. 29. Deliberota morte ferocior. “Becomiug more fierce by
a determined resolution to die! ¹—30. Saeuis Liburnis, ἃς. “ Because,
being a haughty woman, she disdaincd being led away in the hostile
galleys of the Liburniam, deprived of all her former rank, for the purpose
of graeing the pipoud triumph of A11g1istu’s.”—3·2. Superbo triumpho
is here put by a Graccism for ad superbum triumphum. The ‘naves
Liburna were a kind of lio ht galleis used by the Liburnians, an Illyrian
noealong the coast of the Adriatic, addicted to piraey. To ships of Πῖῖἐ
construction Augustus was in a great measure indebted for his victory at
Actium. The vessels of Antonv, on the other hand, were remarkable for

 

their t size. CompfiE‘Tfie tumid description of Florus, (iv. ll. 5.)
