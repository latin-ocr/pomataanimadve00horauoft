At quum Tonantis annus hibernus J ovis
Imbres nivesque comparat, 30
Ant trudit acres hinc et hinc multa cane
Apros in obstantes plagas 3
Aut amite levi rara tendit retia,
Turdis edacibus dolos ;
Pavidumque leporem, ct advenam laqueo gruem, 35
J ucunda captat praemia.
Quis non malarum, quas amor curas habet,
Haec inter obliviscitur?
Quod si pudica mulier in partem juvet
Domum atque dulces liberos, 40
Sabina qualis, aut perusta solibus
Pernicis uxor Appuli,
Sacrum et vetustis extruat lignis focum,
Lassi sub adventum viri ;
Claudensque textis cratibus laetum peeus, 45
Distento. siccet ubera ;
Et horna dulci vina promens dolio,
Dapes inemtas apparet :
