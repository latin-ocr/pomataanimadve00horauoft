Custode rerum Caesare, non furor
Civilis aut vis exiget otium,
Non ira, quae procudit enses,
Et miseras inimicat urbes. 20

Non, qui profundum Danubium bibunt,
Edicta. rumpent J ulia, non Getae,
Non Seres, infidive Persae,
Non Tanain prope flumen orti.

Cum prole matronisque nostris,

—30. Lydis remixto carmine tibiis. “In song, minglcd alternately
with the Lydian flutes;” i. e. with alternate vocal and instrumental music.
The Lydian flutes were the same with what were called the right-lianded
flutes. Among the ancient flutes, tliose.most frequently mentioned are
the tibiae deoecrae and sinistrae, pares aud impares. It would seem
that the double flute consisted of two tubes, which were so joined together
as to have 'hut one mouth, and so were both blown at once. That which
the musician played on with his n‘ght hand was called tibia deoetra, the
right-handed flute3 with his left, the tibia sinistra, the left-handed ssute.
The latter had but few heles, and sounded a deep, serious bass; the other
had many holes, and asharper and livelier tone. The right-handed flutes,
as has already been remarked, were tho same with what were called thc-
vLydian, while the left-handed were identical with what were denominated
the Tyriam—31. Almae prayertiem Veneris ‚- an allusion to Augustus,
who had passed by adoption into the Julian family, and eonsequently
clagmxed descent, with that line, from Ascanius, the grandson of Anchise-³
an enus.
