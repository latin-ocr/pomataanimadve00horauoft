Olim juventas ct patrius vigor
Nido laborum propulit inscium :
Veruique, jam nimbis remotis,
Insolitos docuere nisus

Venti paventem : mox in ovilia
Demisit hostem vividus impetus: 10

only twenty-three years of age, a son of Tiberius Nero and Livia, and a
step-son consequently of the emperor, was sent against them with an
army. The expedition proved eminently successful. Thc young prince,
in the very first battle, defeated the Raeti at the Tridentine Alps, and
afterwards, in conjunction with his brother Tiberius, whom Augustus had
added to the war, met with thc same good fortune against the Vindelici,
united with the temnant of the Raeti and with others of their allies.
(Compare Dio Cassius. liv. 223 Vell.Pate1-c. ii. 95.) Horace, being
ordered by Augustus (Sueten. Vit. Horae.) to celebrate these two vic-
tofles in song, composed the present ode in honour of Drusus, and the
fourteeuth of this same book in praise of Tiberius. The piece we are now
considering consists of three divisions. In the first, the valour of Drusus
is the theme, and he is compared by the poet to a young⁷ engle and lion:
in the second, Augustus is extolied for his paterual care of ,the two
princes, and for the correct culture bestowed upon them x in the third, the
praises of the Claudian line are sung, and mention is made of C. Claudius
Nero, the conqueror of Hasdrubal, after the victory achieved by whom,
over the brother of Hannibal, Fortunc again smiled propitious on tho arms
of Rome.
