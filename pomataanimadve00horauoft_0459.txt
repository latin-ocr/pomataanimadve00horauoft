SERMONUM LIB. ΙΙ. 5. 4ὶῖ

Demissum genus Aenea, tellure marique

Magnus erit, forti nubet procera Corano

Filia Nasicae, metuentis reddere soldum. 05
Tum gener hoc faciet 3 tabulas socero dabit, atque

Ut legat orabit. Multum Nasica negatas

Accipiet tandem, ct tacitus leget, invenietque

Nil sibi legatum praeter plorare suisque.

Illud ad haec jubeo : mulier si forte dolosa 70
Libertusve senem delirum temperet, illis

Accedas socius ; laudes, lauderis ut absens.

Adjuvat hoc quoque, scd vincit longe prius, ipsum
Expugnare caput. Scribet mala carmina vecors?

Laudato. Scortator erit? cave te roget 3 ultro 75
Penelopam facilis potiori trade.

Juvenis. The reference is to Octavianus (Augustus). As the present
satire was written between A. U. C. 719 and 721, Octavianus at this
time must have been about thirty years of age, and might, therefore,
without any impropriety, be still called juvenis, according to the Roman
acceptation of the term,—Partlzis horrendus. Consult notes on Ode 1.
xxvi. 3, and 111. v. 3.-Ab alto demissum genus Aenea,- alluding to
the origin of the Julian line, into which Octavianus had come by adop—
ti0n.---65. Metuentis reddere soldum. “ Disquictcd about the repayment
of the principa] that he owes.'' Soldum (contracted from solidum) here
denotes the principal, οι· the main debt itself, as distinguished from the
interest. The disquict of Nasica, in the promises, may have arisen
from avaricious feelings, or else, and, what is far more probable. from a
consciousness of his inability to refund what he had borrowed. His
creditor is Coranus, to whom he therefore marries his daughter, in the
hope that his new son-in-law will either forgive him the debt at once, or
else leave him a legacy to that amount in his will, which would of course
be a virtual release. He is disappointed in both these expectations.
Coranus makes his will, and hands it to his father-in-law, with a request
that he will read it: the latter, aster repeatedly declining so to do, at
last consents, and finds, to his surprise and mortification, no mention made
in the instrument of any bequcst to him or his.--67. Multum Nasica
negatas, &c. The etiquette of the day required, that in a ease like this
there should be merely an interchange of compliments, but no actual
examination of the will. Poor Nasica, however, could not resist the
tempting offer, ancl was pajd for his curiosity.---69. Praeter plorare.
“Except to go and moum ;'’ i. e. except the bitter feelings attendant

upon disappointed hopes.
