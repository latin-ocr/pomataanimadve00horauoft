SERMONUM LIB. 1. 3. 305

Verbera, non vereor, quum dicas esse pares res

Furta latrociniis, et magnis parva mineris

Falce recisurum simili te, si tibi regnum

Permittant homines. Si dives, qui sapiens est,

Et sutor bonus, et solus formosus, et est rex ; 125
Cur optas quod habes 2—Non nosci, quid pater, inquit,
Chrysippus dicat. Sapiens crepidas sibi nunquam

Nec solcasfccit ,· sutor tamen est sapiens—Qui ,9

Ut, quamvis tacet Hermogenes, cantor tamen atque
Optimus est modulator ; ut Alfenus vafer, omni 130

lead at the end. This was used in correctiug great offenders—120. Ne
serula caedas, ἂρ. Thesernla was a ‘⁸ rod‚'' or stick, with which, as
with the scutica, boys at school were accustomed to he c01-1·cctcd.—122.
sslaylzis parva. “ small equally with great 01}‘‹·11‹·es.''——123. Si tibi rey-
num, ἀεὶ. The poet purposciy adopts this phrasvulogy, that he may pass
the more easily, by means of it, to another ridiculous maxim of the Stoic
school. Hence the tmin of reasoniug is as follows : Thou sayest, that thou
wilt do this if men will only entrust the supreme power into thy hands.
But why wait for this, when. according to the very tenets of thy sect, thou
already hast what thou wantest P For thy philosophy teaehcs thee that the
wisc man is iu fact a king. The doctrine of the Stoics about their wise
man, to which the poet here alludes, was strangcly marked with extrava-
ganee and absurdity. For example, they asserted, that he fecis neither
pain nor plcasure3 that he exerciscs no pity2 that he is free from saults;
that he is divine·, that hc can neither deceive uor be deceived3 that he
does all things well ς that he alone is great, noble, ingenuous, that he is
the only friend3 that he alone is free3 that he is a. prophet, a priest, and a.
king3 and the like. ln order to conceive thc true notion of the Stoics
concerning their wisc man, it must be clearly understood, that they did
not suppose such a. man actually to exist, hut that they framcd in their
imaginatiou an image of perfectiori towards which every man should con-
stantly aspire. All the extravagant things which are to be met within
their writings on this subject, may be referred to their general principle, of
the entire sufficiency of virtue to happincSS, and the consequent indiffer-
ence of all exter-nal circumstances. (Eniieldfs Hist. Phil. vol. i. p. 346.

{gg—132. 126. Non nodi, quid pater, &c- The Stoic is here sup-
posed to rcjoin, and to attempt an explanation of this pcculiar doctrine of
his sech—127. Chrysippus. After Zeno, the founder of the school, no
philosopher more truly cxliibitcd the character, or more strongly displaycd
the doctrines, of the Stoic sect, than Chrysippus.—Crepidas neo soleas.
‘⁶ Either sandals or slippers.”—-l29. Hermo-qenes. The sanie with the
Tigellius mentioned at the beginning of this Satira—130. Alfenus vafer.
“The subtle Alfenus.” Alfenus Varus, a barber of Cremona, growing
out of eonceit with his profession. quitted it, and came to Rome, where,
attending the lecturos of Servius Sulpicius, a celebrated lawyer, he made so
great proficieucy in his studies, as to become eventuall y the ablest lawyer
of his time. = His name osten occurs in the Pande-ets. He was advanced
