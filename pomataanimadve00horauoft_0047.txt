The violence of the storin forced the waves of the Tiber fron] the upper
or Tuscau shore, and caused a'n inundation on the lower bank, or left
side, of the river, where Rome was situated.—-l5. Monumenta Reyis.
‘⁴ The memorial of king Numa ;’' alluding to the palace oLEuAn—z-i, which,
according to Plutarch, stood in the immediate vicinity of the temple of
Vesta, and was distinct from his-other residence on the Quiiinal Hills&

ut. Vit. Numae, 14.)—16. Vestae. ‘What made'the omen‘a‘pecu-
liarly alarming one was, that the sacred‘fire was kept in this temple, on
the preservation of which the safeiffifWIJe empire was supposed, in a
great measure, to depend. Compare Ovid, Trist. ω. i. 29. ‘⁶ Hic
jocus est Vestae, qui Pallada servat et iynem.'’ If a vcstal virgin
allowed the sacred tire to be extinguished, she was scourf ed by tho Ponti-
fex Maximus. Such an accident was always esteemed most unlucky, aud
expiated by offering extraordinary sacrifices. The firc was lighted up
again, not from another fire, but from thegays of the sun, in which mau-
ner it was rcncwed every year on the first of March, that day being aa·
ciently the beginning of the year. Compare Lipsius, dc Vesta et Vestal-
ibus Syntayma.

17—19. 17. Iliae dum se, διο. “ While the god of the stream,
lending too ready an ear to the wishes of his spouse, proudly shows him-
self an intemperate avenger to the complaining Hiass‘ The allusion is to
Ilia, or Rea Silvia, the moth-cr of Romulus ffidREfnus, and the ancestress
of Julius Caesar, whose assassination she is here represented as bewailinz.
Ancient authorities differ in relation to her fate. Α Ennius, cited by PE?-
pbyrion in his scholia on this ode, makes hcr to have been &ist—into the

⁸ Tiber, previous to which she had become the bride of the Anio. Horace.
on the contrary, speaks of her as having married the god of the Tiber‚
which he here designates, as uoeorius amnis. Servius (ad Aen. i. 274.)
alludes to this version of the fable as adopted by Horace and others. Acron
also, in his scholia on the present passage, speaks of Ilia as having married
the god of the Tiber. {rAccording to the account which he gives, Ilia was
buried on the banks of the A—nio, and the river, having overflowcd its
horden, carried her remains down to the Tiber: hence she was said to
have espoused the deity K( the last-mentioned stream. It may not be im-
proper to add here a remark of Niebuhr’s in relation to the name of this
female. “ The readinij-heaj' observes the historiae, ‘⁴ is a corruption
introduced by the editors, who very unseasonably bethought themselves of
the goddess: rea seems only to have signified the culm-it, or the guilty
woman3 it re‘rfiffids us of rea semina, which often occurs, particularly iu
Boccaocio.’' (Niebuhr’s Roman Hister-y, vol. i. p. 176, 2d edit. Herc
and Thirlwall's transl.)—Nimium,· taken as an adjective, and referring
to Ultorem. It alludes to the violence of the inundation. Some com-
mentators connect it a< an adverb with querenti, “ the too-complai11ing.’'
