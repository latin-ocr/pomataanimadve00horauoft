484 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Inter vina fugam Cinarae moerere protervae„
Forte per angustam tenuis nitedula rimam
Repserat in cumeram frumenti, pastaque rursus 3ο
Ire foras pleno tendebat corpore frustra.
Cui mustela procul, Si vis, ait, effugere isti-nc,
Macra cavum repetes arctum, quem macra subisti,
Hac‘ego si compellor imagine, cuncta resigno.
Nec somnum plebis laudo, satur altilium, nec 35>
Otia divitiis Arabum liberrima muto.
Saepe verecundum laudasti3 Rexque Paterque

laugh that once was mine.''—28. cmyam Cinarae protervae. Horace,
elsewhere, (Ode 1v. i. 3) tells us, that he was a young man when he
surrendered his heart to the charms of Cinara.

29—34. 29. Forte per anyustam, ἃς, The construction in the
grain of·ideas is as follows ε 1 am not one, Maeceuas, that wishes merely
io seed and fatten in thy abode 3 I have not crept into thy dwelling as
the field-mouse did into the basket of corn ; for if Ι am indeed like thc
field-mouse in the fable, and if my only object in coming nigh thee has
had reference to self, then am I willing to surrender all the favours
that thy kindness has bestowed upon me. ·—Tenuz's nitedula. “ A lean
field-mouse. ”—30. C'umeram frumenti. ‘⁴ A basket of corn.”——3l.
Pleno corpore. ‘⁴ Being grown fat.”—34. Hac eyo si compellor imagine,
&a “ If I be addressed by this similitude, I am ready to 'resign all
that thy favour has bestowed ;” z'. e. if this fable of the field-mouse be
applicable to me, if I have crept into thy friendship merely to enjoy
thy munificent kindness and benefit myself, &c.--Resiyno. Consult
note on Ode 111. xxix. 54.

35—37. 35. Nec somnum plebis laudo, ἃς. “ Neither do Ῑ, sated
with (lelicacies, applaud the slumbers of the poor, nor am I willing to
exchange my present repose, and the perfect fre-edom that accompanies
it, for all the riches of the Arabians.” The poet means to convey the
idea, that he is not one of those who first surfeit themselves, and then
extol the frugal tables and the easy slumbers of· the poor, but that he
has always loved a life of repose and freedom, and will always prefer
such a one to the splendours of the highest affluenee. Hence the
same idea is involved in this sentence as in the passages which imme-
diately precede, namely, that the poet has never sought the friendship
of his patron merely for the sake of indulging in a life of luxury—‘—
Altilz'um. The epithet altilis, in its general import, denotes any thing
fattened for human food 3 when taken in ‘a special sense, however, as
in the present instance, it refers to birds, particularly those of the rarer
kind, reared for this purpose in an aviary.—37. Saepe verecundum laud-
asti ,· Rexque Palemque, &o ‘⁶ Thou hast often commended my mode-
ration: when present thou hast heard thyself saluted by me as King
and Father; nor have 1 been more sparing in thy praise when thou
west absent, by a single word.” For 3 literal translation, understand
audisti with nec verbo parcius absens ; and, as regards the peculiar mean-
