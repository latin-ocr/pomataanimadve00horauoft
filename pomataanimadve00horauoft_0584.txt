Q. HORATH FLAocr
EPISTOLARUM

LIBER SECUNDUS.

Erlsrmz I.—This is the celebrated epistle to Augustus, who it seems
had, in a kind and friendly manner, chid our poet, for not having ad-
dressed to him any of his satiric or epistolary compositions. The chief
object of Horace, in the verses which he in consequence inscribed to
the emperor, was to propitiate his favour in behalf of the poets of the
day. One great obstacle to their full enjoyment of imperial patronage‚
and to their success with the public in general, arose from that inordi-
nate admiration which prevailed for the works of the older Roman
poets. A taste, whether rcal or pretended, for the most antiquated
productioris, appears to have been almost universal, and Augustus him-
self showed manifest symptoms of this predilection. (Compare Sue—
tonius, Vz't. Any. c. 89.) In the age of Horace, poetry had no doubt
been greatly improved3 but, hitherto, criticism had been little culti-
vated, and, as yet, had scarcely been professed as an art among the
Romans. Hence the public taste had not kept pace with the poetical
improvements, and was scarcely fitted, or duly prepared, to relish them.
Some, whose ears were not yet accustomed to the majesty of Virgil's
numbers, or the softness of Ovid's versification, were still pleased with
the harsh and rugged measure, not merely of the most ancient hexame-
ter, but even of the Saturnian lines ; while others, impenetrable to the
refined wit and delicate irony of Horace himself, retained their prefer—
ence for the coarse humour and quibbling jests which disgraced the old
comic drama. A few of these detractors may have affected, merely
from feelings of political spleen, to prefer the unbridled scurrility, and
the bold uncompromising satire of a republican age, to those courtly
refinements, which they might wish to insinuate were the badges of
servitude3 but the greater number obstinately maintained this parti-
ality from malicious motives, and with a view, by invidious comparison‚
to disparage and degrade their contemporaries who laid claim to poetical
renown. Accordingly, the first aim of Horace, in his epistle to Augus-
tus, is to lessen this undue admiration, by a satirical representation of
the faults of the ancient bards, and the absurdity of those who, in
spite of their manifold defects, were constantly extolling them as
models of peffeetion. But it must be admitted, that, in pursuit of this
object, which was in some degree selfish, Horace has too much depre-
ciated the Fathers of Roman-song. He is in no degree conciliated by
