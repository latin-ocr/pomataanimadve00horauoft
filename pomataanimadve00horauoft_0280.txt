240 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Ut ora vertat huc et huc euntium
Liber-rima indignatio 2 10
‘⁶ Seetus flagellis hic Triumviralibus‚
Praeconis ad fastidium,
Arat 'Falerni mille fundi jugera
Et Appiam mannis terit,-
Sedilibusque magnus in primis eques, 15
Othone contemto, sedet.
Quid attinet tot ora navium gravi
Rostrata duci pondere
Contra latrones atque servilem manum,
Hoc, hoc tribuno militum ?'’ 20

resnrt for the idle, and for those who wished to display themselves to
public view. Compare Serm. 1. ix. 1.-—8. Cum histriam ulnarum toya.
The wealthy and luxurious were fond of appearing abroad in long and
loose gowns, as a mark of their opulence and rank-9. Ut ora vertat, &c-
”‘ How the indignation of those who pass to and fro, most openly expressed,
turns their looks on thee.''

11—20. 11. Sectus flweHis, &e. “This wretch, (say they) cut
with the rods of the triumvirs until the beadle was weary,’' δίο. The
allusion is to the Triumviri Capitales, who judged concerning slaves and
persons ot the lowest rank, and who also had the charge of the prison,
and of the execution of condemned criminals.—13. Arat. In the sense
of possidet.—Falerni fundi. The wealthy Romans were accustomed to
have large possessions in the fertile country of Campania, which is here
designated by the name of its celebrated vineyards.—14. Et Appiam
mannis terit. ⁴‘ And wears out the very Appian VVay with his horses 3 ''
i. e. is constantly frequenting the Appian Way with his long train of
equipage.—15. Sedilibusque maynus, διο. According to the law of
L. Roscius Otho, passed A. U. C. 686, fourteen rows of benches, imme.
diately after the orchestra, a place where the senate sat, were appropriated
in the theatre and amphitheatro for the accommodation of the knights.
As the tribunes of the soldiers had an equal right with the Equites, they
were entitled to seats in this same quarter3 and hence the individual to
whom the poet alludes, though of servile origin, boldly takes his place on
the foremost of the equestrian benches‚ nor fears the law of otha—17.
Quid attinet, διο. “ To what purpose is it that so many vessels,.their
beaks armed with heavy brass, are sent against pirates and a band of slaves,
if this wretch is made a military tribune?” The idea intended to be
conveyed is as follows: Why go to so much expense in equipping fleets
against pirates and slaves, when slaves at home elevate themselves to the
highest stations ? The allusion appears to be to the armament fitted out
by Octavianus (Augustus) against Sextus Pompeius, A. U. C. 718, whose
pn'ncipal strength consisted of pirates and fugitive slaves-20. Tribwno
militum. In each legion there were six military tribunes, each of whom
in battle seems to have had charge of ten centuries, or about a thousand
men ς hence the corresponding Greek appellation is χιλιάρχης.
