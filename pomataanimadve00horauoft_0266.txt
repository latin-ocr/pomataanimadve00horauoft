226 Q· HORATH FLACCI

Sic tauriformis volvitur Aufidus, 25
Qua regna Dauni praefluit Appuli,
Quum saevit, horrendamque cultis
Diluviem meditatur agris ε

Ut barbarorum Claudius agmina
Ferrato, vasto diruit impetu, 30
Primosque et extremos metendo
Stravit humum, sine clade victor,

Te copias, te consilium et tuos
Praebente divos. Nam, tibi quo die
Portus Alexandrea supplex 35
Et vacuam patefecit aulam,

Fortuna lustro prospera tertio
Belli secundos reddidit exitus,

Laudemque et optatum peractis
Imperiis decus arrogavit. 40

with the Greek διὰ πυρὸς μαλε-ἲν. The scholiast, on the other hand,
explains it as equivalent to ⁶⁶ per medium puynae servorem.’' We
rather think with Gessner, however, that the reference is to some historical
event which has not come down to iis—25. Sic tauriformis volvitur
Aufidus. “ With the same fury is the bull-formed Aufidus rollcd along.”
The epithet tauriformis, analogous to the Greek ταυρόμορφος, auudes
either to the bull's head, or to the horns with which the gods of rivers
were anciently represented. The scholiasta 011 Euripides (Orest. 1378)
is quite correct in referring the explanation of this to the roaring of their
waters. Consult note οι] Ode 111. xxx. 10.—26. Qua regna Dauni, &c.
“ Where it flows by the realms of Apulian Daunus ;'' i. e. where it
waters the landos Apulia—Praestitit. For praeterfluit. Compare Ode
1v. iii. 10.-—29. Aymina ferrata. “ The iron-clad bands.''—3l. Metendo.
“ By mowing dowu.’'—3·2. Sine clade. “ without loss to himself;’'
τ’. e. with tiiffing injury to his own army.- 33. Consilium et tuos divos.
‘⁴ Thy counsel and thy favoni-ing gods ;'' i. e. thy counsel and thy auspices.
By the expression tuos divos, the poet means the favour of heaven, which
had constantlyaccompanied the arms of Augustus: hence the gods are,
by a bold figure, called his own. A proof of this favour is given in the
very next sentence, in which it is stated, that, on the fifteenth anniversary
of the capture of Alexandrea, the victories of Drusus and Tiberius were
achieved over their barbarian foes.

34—52. 34. Nam, tibi quo die, &m “ For, at the close of the
third lustrum from the day on which the suppliant Alexandrea opened wide
to thee her harbours and deserted court, propitious For-tune gave a favour-
able issue to the war.'' Alexandrea was taken A. U. C. 724, and the
war with the Raeti and Vindelici was brought to a close A. U. C· 739.
