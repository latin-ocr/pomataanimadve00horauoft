EPODON LIBER. 14. 259

Caetera mitte loqui: deus haec fortasse benigna
Reducet in sedem vice. Nunc et Achaemenio
Perfundi nardo juvat, et fide Cyllenea
Levare diris pectora sollicitudinibus. 10
Nobilis ut grandi cecinit Centaurus alumno :—-
“ Invicte, mortalis dea nate, puer, Thetide,
Te manet Assaraci tellus, quam frigida parvi
Findunt Scamandri flumina, lubricus et Simo'is;
Unde tibi reditum curto subtemine Parcae 15
Rupere ; nec mater domuin caerula te revehet.
Illic omne malum vino cantuque levato,
Deformis aegrimoniae dulcibus alloquiis.”

CARMEN XIV.
AD MAECENATEM.

MOLLIS inertia cur tantam diffuderit imis
Oblivionem sensibus,

pro yravieate ac severitate accipe.¹'——6. Tu vina Torquato move, &c.
The poet, eager for the expected entertainment, imagines his friends
already present, and, addressing himself to one os the party supposed
to be assembled, exclaims‚ “ Do thou produce the wine, pressed when
my Torquatus was consul.'' The force of move, in this passage, is best
explained on the principle that this was to be a feast of contribution‚ and ,
that Horace calls first upon him who was to surnish the wine( The
wine to be drunk on this occasion is that which had been made in tho
year when L. Manlius Torquatus was consul. Consult note on Ode 11:-
xxi. l.

Thc poet alludes to some cause of anxiety on the part of his friend.—
Deus baec sortasse beniqua, &c. “ Perhaps the deity will, by a kind
change, restore what now disquiets thee to its former state.’¹-8. Achae-
menio. Consult note on Ode ιιι. i. 44.—-9.. Cyllenea. The lyre is here
called ‘⁴ Cyllenean,'' because invented by Mercury, who was born on
Cyllene,a mountain in the northern part os Arcadia, on the borders of
Achaia.-—ll. Nobilis Centaurus. Chiron.—Alnmno. Achilles—13.
Assaraci telluS. “ The land of Assaracus,” i. e. Troy. Assaracus, son
of Tros, was one of the ancient monarchs of Troy.-15. Curio subtemine.
‘⁸ By a short thread.” The common lection, certo subtemine, (“ by a
thread that fixes thy destin)·,'') is far inferior. The terni subtemen means
properly the woqf or west. i. e. the threads inserted into the warp.—-

18.l Deformis amrimoniae, &c. “ Tho sweet soothers of disflguring
