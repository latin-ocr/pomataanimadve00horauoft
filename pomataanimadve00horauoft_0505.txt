mmus, &c. “We are a mere number.'' Numerus is here a word of
contempt, and spoken of men as mere cyphers, who served no other
end but to fill up places. The connexion in the train of ideas is as
follows : We, therefore, who do not follow the example of virtue and of
visdom which is set before us in the character of Ulysses, seem born
only to consume the productioris of the carth, and to add to the bulk
of mankind. We are no better than the suitors of Penelope; we are
no better than the effeminate and luxurious Phreacians, whose chief
employment consisted in pompei-ing their bodies, in prolonging their
slumbers until mid-day, and in dispelling their cares with wine, dancing‚
and song.

28—30. 28. Sponsi Penelopae, nebulones Alcinoique. “ Mere suitors
of Penelope, mere effeminate and luxurious suhjects of Alcinous.⁹³ The
term nebulones is here used in a somewhat softcned sense, though still
full of reproach, and the allusion is to the Phaeacians‚ over whom Alci-
nous ruled, and who were famed for their soft and effeminate mode of
life, as well as their luxurious indulgence. The Phaeacia of Homer was
the Corcyra of later geography, now &ism—³29. In czde curanda plus
aequo operata juventus. ‘⁶ A race occupied, more than was proper, in
pampering their bodies ;” i. e. in feasting and the pleasures of the table.
The allusion is still to the subjects of Alcinous ; and this is continued to
the end of the 3lst verse—30. Et ml strepitum citharae cessatum ducere
euram. “And to lull their cares to rest by the tones of the Iyre.’'
Cessatum is the supine.

32-37. 32. Ut juyulent hominem, ἃς. The poet now calls off the
attention of'his young friend from the picture he has just drawn of indo-
lence and effeminacy, to the importance of active and industrious exertion
in promoting the great ends of moral and mental improvement—33. Ue
te ipsum serves· “ To save thyself ;” i. e. from the evils attendant on
slothful indolence-Atqui εἰ noles sanus, curres hydropicus. “Well
then, if thou wilt not use exercise when in hcalth, thou wilt have to run
when dropsical.” People in the dropsy were ordered by their physicians
to use active exercise. Horace, it will be observed, intends the allusion
to the dropsy in a metaphorica] sense, and the idea which he means to
convey is simply this: If thou wilt not exert thy power when thou canst,
thou shalt be made to do so when no altemative is lem-34. Et ni posces

every individua} arose at the break of day to attend to his particular
