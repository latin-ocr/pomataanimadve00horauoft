Silvis educti caveant, me judice, Fauni,

Ne, velut innati triviis ac paene forenses, 245

Aut nimium teneris juvenc-ntur versibus unquam,

Aut immunda crepent ignominiosaque dicta.

Offenduntur enim, quibus est equus, et pater, et res;

N ec, si quid fricti ciceris probat et nucis emtor,

connexion which Horace here calls ι)’κιιι·ἰιιι·(ι.--“.).43. Tantum de medio
sumtis accedit honoris. “ So much grace may be imparted to subjects
taken from the common mass ;’' i. e. so capable are the meanest and
plainest things os ornament and grace—⁸244. Silvis educti caveant, me
judice, Fauni, διο. “ Fauns bred in the woocls should take care, in my
opinion, never either to sport in too tender lays, like persons brought
up within the precincts of the city, and almost as if accustomed to the
harangues of the Forum 3 nor, on the other hand, to express themselves
in obscene and abusive language.” The poet, having before (line 232)
settled the true idea of the satyrio style in general, now treats, observes
Hurd, of the peculiar language of the Satyrs themselves. This com-
mon sense demands to be in cont'ormity with their sylvan character,
neither affectedly tender and gallant, on the one hand; nor grossiy and
offensively obscene, on the other. The first of these cautions seems
levelled at a salse improvement, which, on the introduction of the
Roman Satyric Drama, was probably attempted on the simple rude plan
of the Greek, without considering the rustic extraction and manners ot
the F auns and Satyrs;· the latter obliquely glauces at the impurities ot
the Atellane pieces, whose licentious ribaldry would of course insect the
first essays ot' Roman Satyric composition. l

245-249. 245. Forenses. The allusion appears to be to the
sorensic harangues and declamations in which the young Romans were
accustomed to exercise themselves, and to the choice expressions whici.
they aimed at employing in such performances.——246. Juvenentw.
This is thought to be a word with which the poet himself enriched hs
native tongue, and is formed after the analogy of the Greek νεανιεύεσθαι.
-248, Offenduntur enim, quibus est equus, διο. For they are offended
at this, who have a steed, a father, or an estate.'' The allusion is to
the Equites, the Patr-iciam, and the wealthier portion of the people3
in other words, to the more polite and educated classes. The por-2
observes Hurd, in his endeavour to reclaim his countrymen from the
taste obscene, very politely, by a common figure, represents that as being
the fact, which he wished to be so.—249. fricti ciem-is et nucis emtor.
“ The purchasers of parched peas and nuts;’' alluding to the lower
orders, who purchased these articles for the purpose ef consuming them
during the representation of a piece. The pea-nut eaters of our own
day form a similar fraternity.

251—260. 251. Syllaba longa brevi suly'ecta, διο. The whole erl-
tique on the Satyric Drama here concludes with some directions about
the iambie verse. Not that this metre was common to tragedy ano ;he
