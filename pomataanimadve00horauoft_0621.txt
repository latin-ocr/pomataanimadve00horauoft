At qui legitimum cupiet fecisse poema,
Cum tabulis animum censoris sumet honesti; 110
Audebit quaecunque parum splendoris habebunt,
Et sine pondere erunt, et honore indigna ferentur,
Verba movere loco, quamvis invita recedant,
Et versentur adhuc intra penetralia Vestae.
obscurata diu populo bonus eruet, atque 115
Proferet in lucem speciosa vocabula rerum,
Quae, priscis memorata Catonibus atque Cethegis,

but when the ardour of imagination has gone by, a good poet will ex-
amine his work in cool blood, and shall find it sink greatly in his own
esteem. On the other hand, the more a had poet reads his productione
over, the more he is charmed with them, se veneratur amatque.

109—114. 109. At qui leyilimum cupiet secisse pois'ma. Horace,
after having described, in amusing colours, the vanity and conceit of
bad poets, now draws a picture of a good one, and lays down some
excellent precepts for the guidance of writers. This is a continuation
of his reasoning. He has shown that a poet, foolishly pleased with his
own works, draws up‘on himself ridicule and contempt, and he here
speaks of the great exertion requisite to give value to a poem. Hence
he concludes, that poetry is a task in which no wise and prudent man
will ever engage—Leyitimum poe'ima. ‘⁵ A genuine poem 3⁹⁹ i.e. one
eomposed in accordanee with all the mles and precepts of art.—llO.
Cum tabulis animum censoris honesti. The idea intended to be conveyed
is this, that such a writer as the one here described will take his waxed
tablets, on which he is going to compose his strains, with the same
feeling that an impartial critic will take up the tablets that are to con-
tain his criticisms. For, as a fair and honest critic will mark whatever
saults are deserving of being noted, so a good poet will correct what-
'ever things appear in his orm productions worthy of correction.—lll.
Audebit. ‘⁶ He will not hesitate.’'-—ll3. Alei-ere loco. “ To reinove.'‘
We would say, in our modern phraseology, ‘⁵ to blot out.”—ll4. Intr:
penetralia· Vestae. ‘⁴ Within the inmost sanctuary of Vesta ;'' i. e. within
the recesses of his cabinet or eloset. Peneo-alia Vestae is a figurative
expression. None but the Pontifex Maximus was allowed to enter
within the inmost shrine of the temple of Vesta, and with this sacred
place is the poet‘s cabinet compared. Here his works are in a privileged
abode, inaccessible to the criticisms of the publie; and it is here that
the poet himself should act the part of a rigid censor, retrench whatever
is superfluous, and give the finishing hand to his pieces.

115--124. 115. Obscuram din populo bouus eruet, δῖε. ’Πιθ order
of construction is as follows : Bonus (poeta vel scriptor) eruet atque in
lucem proferet populo, cui illa diu obscurata sunt, speciosa vocabula rerum,
quae, memorata priscis Catonibus atque Cethe-qis, insomnis situs et deserta
vetustas nunc premit.-l 16. Speciosa. “ Expressive.”—117. Memorato.
“Used ;'' equivalent to usurpata—Priscis Catonibus atque Cetkeyis.
Cato the censor is here meant ; and the epithet applied to him is in-
tended to refer to his observance of the plain and austere manners of
