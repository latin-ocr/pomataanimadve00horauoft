them out3 and tne chorus was exercised the same way. This was
more particularly the 0115 0 among the Greeks. Hence we obtain the
primitive meaning of δι( dat-ew δρᾶμα ((ἰι1εενε]”ιώιιίαηι),· and from this
others os 11 more general nature result, such as, “to give a play to be
acted,” “to exhibit 8 piece,' or, as in the present 01158, s1mply to

derstand fabulas. The term togatae (scil. subulae) was 115 ed to denote
all plays 111 which the habits, manners, and arguments were Rornan;
and palliatae, those of which the customs and subjects were Grecian.

the praetexta was a robe appropriatcd to the higher orders, whereas the
toqa was the common Roman habit.

correction ;’' literally ‘⁴ of the file.”—292. Pompilius sanguis. “ De-
scendants of Pompilius.’' The family of the Pisos claimed descent from
Numa Pompilius.—-Carmen reprehendite, quod 71οη multa dies, &c.
“ Condemn that poem which many a day and many a blot have not
corrected, and castigated ten times to perfect accuracy. ’³ Co'c'rcuit' is
here equivalent to emendando purgavit. —294. Praesectum ad unguem3
literallyff ‘to the pared nail.’' A metaphor taken from workers in
marble‚ who try the smoothness of the marble‚ and the exactness of the
joinings‚ by drawing the nail over them.

295, 296. 295. Ingenium misera quia fortunatius arte, 810. “Be-

and therefore excludes sane poets from Helicon. '' Compare note on
