mulsum, nor for flsh, but wilt appease thy sharpened appetite with plain
bread and salt.-—9. Leporem sectatus, equove, ἃς. Hunting and riding

Hymettia mella Falerno, &c.; an allusion to the Roman drink called
mulsum, which was made of vn'ne and honey. As the F alemian here
indicates the choieest wine, so the Hymettian is meant to designate the
best honey. The drink here referred to was generally taken to whct the
appetite—17. Defendens pisces. “ Protecting its flsh ;” i. e. from
