SERMONUM LIB. 11. 8. 43!

Gausape purpureo mensam pertersit, et alter

Sublegit quodcunque jaceret inutile, quodque

Posset coenantes offendere: ut Attica virgo

Cum sacris Cereris, procedit 'fuscus Hydaspes

Caecuba vina ferens, Alcon Chium maris expers. 15
Hic herus, Albanum, Maecenas, sive Falernum

Te magis appositis delectat, habemus utrumque.

Divitias miseras ! Sed queis coenantibus una,
Fundani, pulchre fuerit tibi, nosse laboro.

Puer alte cinctus, “ A young slave tueked high.” Among the
Romans, the young slaves, employed in the interior of the dwellings.
were generally clad in a short tunic, descending no further than the
kneae. This was done, not so much with a view to activity and expe—
dition as from a retinement of luxury. The eustom is here carried by
Nasidienus to a ridiculous extreme, in order that every part of this
strange entertainment may be in unison.—Acernam. According to
Pliny (Hist. Nat. xvi. 15) the maple was next in value to the citron-wood.
The scholiast remarks, that the circumstance of his having a maple-
wood table is another proof of the sordid habits of Nasidienus, since
a man of his riches should have had a table of citron-wood, with which,
too, the ραῑιεαρε purpureum, mentioned immediately after, would have
much better comported.—ll. Gausape purpureo. The Gausapa (sum-
sapa or gau-sapum) was a kind of towel or eloth, having on one side a
long nap: those used by the rich were made of wool, and dyed of some
,bright σῶσαι-Εἰ alter subleyit quodcunque jaceret inutile, &c. The
allusion is to the fragments of the feast, the crumbs, bones, δίο. The
slave, whose duty it was to collect these, was styled analecta. .
13—19. 13. Ut Attica viryo cum sacris Cereris. The allusion is to
the Caneplwri, or young Athenian females, who bore, at the mystic
festival of Ceres and Proserpine, certain sacred symbols belonging to the
secret worship of these deities, covered over in baskets. Their paco.
was always slew and solemn. Horace, in expressing the comparison
between the gait of Hydaspes and that of the females just alluded to,
means, of course, to tum into ridicule the stately march of the slave.—
14. Hydaspes. A slave, as his name proves, from India. The wealthy
Romans were fond of having in their heusehold establishments slaves
of various nations.—-l5. Chium maris emper& Horace is generally
supposed to mean, that this wine, sei-ved up by Nasidienus, was of
inferior quality, from the want of salt water: it is more probable, how-
ever, that by expers maris he intends to insinuate, that the wine in ques
tion was a factitious or home-made kind, “ which had never crossed the
sect-18 Divitias miseras! Not uttered by Nasidienus, as some
commentatore pretend, but by Horace. The poet makes use of this
expression as a kind of apposition with utrumque in the preceding line.
Fundanius states, that he 'nas both Alban and Falernian wine, and yet
he is prevented by his avarice from offering them to his guests. Horace
