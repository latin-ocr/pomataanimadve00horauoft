412 Q. HORATII FLACCI

TIRFSIAS.

Jamne doloso
Non satis est Ithacam revehi, patriosque penates
Adspicere ’.3

ULYssEs.
O nulli quidquam mentite, vides ut 5

Nudus inopsque domum redeam, te vate, neque illic
Aut apotheca procis intaeta est, aut pecus, Atqui
Et genus et virtus, nisi cum re, vilior alga est.

TIRESIAS.
Quando pauperiem, missis ambagibus, horres,
Accipe, qua ratione queas ditescere. Turdus 10

Sive aliud privum dabitur tibi, devolet illuc,

Res ubi magna nitet, domino sene ς dulcia poma,

Et quoscunque feret cultus tibi fundus honores,

Ante Larem gustet venerabilior Lare dives3

Qui quamvis perjurus erit, sine gente, cruentus 15
Sanguine fraterno, fugitivus; ne tamen illi

Tu comes exterior, si postulet, ire recuses

1217. 1. Praeter narrata. “ In addition to what thou has‘c already
told me.''-3. Dolosa. Understand tibi.—6. Te vate. ‘⁴ As thou pre-
dictest.''——7. Apotheca. “ My wine-room.'¹—A iqui et yenus et virtus,
See. ‘⁶ While now, as well birth as merit, unless aceompanied by sub-
stance, are held in lower estimation than sea-weed.”—10. Accipe. In
the sense of auda—Turdus sive aliud privum, &c. “ If a thrush, or
any other delicacy, shall be given thee, let it fly thjther,” &c.—13.
Quoscunque honores. ‘⁴ Whatever productions.” The allusion is to the
primitiae, or first-fruits of the year. These were wont to be offered to the
Lares, but on the present occasion, they must go to the rich man, for he
is ‘⁶ venerabilior Lare.¹'—15. Sine yente. “ Of no family.''——16. Ραρί-
tivus. ‘⁴ A run-away slave.⁹’-17. Eoeterz'or. “ On the lest.'’ The
phrase ire comes eoeterior is analogous to latus teyere or claudere, and
both, according to the best commentators‚ signify, “ to aecompany one on
the left.'’ The term exterior here refers to the position of the sycophant

or legacy-hunter‚ as protecting the rich individuah who in this sense is Α

interior ; and the lest side was the one protected or guarded on such
occasions, because it was considered the weaker of the two, and was
also more exposed to injury or attack.
