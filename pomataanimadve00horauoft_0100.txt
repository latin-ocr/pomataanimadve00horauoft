oARMEN XXVI.
DE AELIO LAMIA.

Musis amicus, tristitiam et metus
Tradam protervis in mare Creticum
Portare ventis: quis sub Arcto
Rex gelidae metuatur orae,

Quid Teridaten terreat, unice 5
Securus. O, quae fontibus integris
Gaudes, apricos necte fiores,
Necte meo Lamiae coronam,

Ome XXVI.-—In praise of Aelius Lamia, a Roman of ancient and
illustrious family, and distinguished for his exploits in the war with the
Cantabri. The bard, wholly occupied with the Muses and his friend,
consigns every othe-r thought to the winds.

2—3. 2. Mare Creticum. The Cretan, which lay to the north of
the island, is here put for any sea—3. Portare. “To waft them.”—-
Quis suh Arcto, &c. ‘⁶ By what people the monarch of a frozen region
beueath the northern sky is feared‚-” &¹:- The present ode appears to
have been written at the time when Phrzffl'ates, king of Parthia, had been
dethroned by his mr his excesjve cruelty, and Ten'dates, who
headed a party against him, appointed in his stead. Phrahates fied for
suceour to the Scythiam, and a monarch of that nation was now on his
march to restore him. lesking of the-{rostri region is therefore the
,Scythian invader, and the people‘kvho fear his approach are the-Parthians,
with Teridates at their head. Dio Cassius informs us that Phrahates
was reinstated in his kingdom, and that Teridates fled into Syria. Here
he was allowed to remain by Augustus, who obtained from him the son

of Phrahates, and led the young priuce as a hostage to Rome. Q
son was subsequently er to the father, and the standards taken by

 

the Parthians from Crassus and Antony were delivered in exchange.
(Compare Dio Cassius, li. 18. vol. i. p. 649. ed. Reim. ‚⁰ Justin. xlii. 5.)
Strab0‚ however, states, that the son of Phrahates was received as a
hostage from the father himself, and along with him sous aud grandsons.
(παῖδας καὶ παίδων παῖδας. Strab. 6. extr.) Compare with tliis the
lauguage of Qe-to-an Vit. Auq. 43‚) who speaks of HQ the
Parthians ( “ Parthorum obsides ”). ,
6—11. 6. Fonlibus inteyris. “ The pure fountains.'’ By thefontes
{meyri lyric poetry is designated, and the poet alludes to the eircum-
stance of his having been the fi'rst of his countrymeu that had refreshed
the literature of Rome with the streams of Q verse. Hence the
invocation of the Muse..-7. Apricos necleflores. ‘⁶ Entwine the sunny
flowers.’' The sunny flowers and the chaplet which they form are
figurative expressions, and mean simply a lyric effusion. 'l'he Muse is
solicited to aid the hard iu celebratiug the praises of his friend.—Pimple'i.
The Muses were called Pimple'ides from Pimplea, a sountain, hill, and
