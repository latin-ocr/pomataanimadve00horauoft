EPISTOLARUM Lm. 1. 1-2. 501

Ab Jove donari possit tibi. Tolle querelas;

Pauper enim non est, cui rerum suppetit usus.

Si ventri bene, si lateri est pedibusque tuis, nil 5
Divitiae poterunt regales addere majus.

Si forte in medio positorum abstemius herbis

Vivis et urtica, sic vives protinus, ut te

ninth ode of the first book is inscribed ; and from that piece it would
appear, that, in pursuit of his d'arling object, he had at one time taken
up the profession of a soldier. Disappointed, however, in this expec-
tation‚ he looked around for other means of accomplishing his views ;
and not in γαίης for Agrippa appointed him superintendent of his
estates in Sicily, a station occupied by him when this epistle was
written. It should be further remarked‚ that the individua] addressed
had pretensious also to the character of a philosopher. In the ode just
referred to, Horace describes him as a philosophical soldier, and here
as a philosophical miser, but he becomes equally ridiculous in either cha-
racter.

1—4. 1. Fructibus Agrippae Siculis. “The Sicilian produce of
Agrippa;” i. e. the produce of Agrippa’s Sicilian estates. Aster the
defeat of Sextus Pompeius off the coast of Sicily, near Messana, and the
subjection of the whole island which followed this event, Augustus, in
return for so important a service, bestowed on Agrippa very extensive
and valuable lands in Sicily. Iccius was agent or farmer over these.—
‘.'. Non est ut. “ It is not possible that.'' An imitation of the Greek
idiom οὐκ ἔστιν ὡς or ὅπως. So that non est ut possit is equivalent in
effect to the simple non potest.—Tolle querelas. We may suppose
Iccius, like other avaricious men, to have indulged in frequent complaints
respecting the stato of his affairs—4. Cui rerum suppetit usus. - ‘⁶ Who
has a sufficiency for all his wants.''-—5. Si ventri bene, &c. The whole
clause, from si to tuis inclusive, is equivalent in effect to si vales.

7—8. 7. δι’ forte. Iccius very probably lived in the way here
described 3 the poet, however, in order to soften down his remark, adds
the term forte, as if he were merely stating an imaginary case.—In
medio positorum. “ Iu the midst of abundance ;” literally, “in the
midst of the things placed before thee.”÷ The reference is to the rich
produce of Agrippa's estates—8. Unica. The reference is not to
nettles, but to the shell-fish, urtica marina. From the last verse of the
epistle it is apparent that it was written in autumn3 whereas nettlae
were only eaten by the poorer classes in the spring, when they were
tender. Resides, the poet mentions fish in the twenty-first lina—Sic
vives protinus ut. Compare the explanation of Hunter: “Sic vivoe
protenus est, sic porro vives, sie peryes vivere, ut (etiamsi) te confestim
liquidus fortunae rivus inauret ; i. e. etiamsi repente dives sactus sis.''
The allusion in the words liquidus Fortunae rivus inauret, is thought by
some commentators to be to the story of Midas and the river Pactolus.
We should have great doubts respecting the aceuracy of this remark.
The phrase in question would rather seem to be one of a mere proverbial
character.
