574 Q. HORATII FLACCI

’ Hic extremo in Aventino 3 visendus uterque:

Intervalla vides humane commoda—Verum 7·
Parae sunt platone, nihil ut meditantibus obstet.—

Festinat calidus mulis gerulisque redemtor;

Torquet nune lapidem, nunc ingens machina tignum ;
Tristia robustis luctantur funera plaustris 3

Hac rabiosa fugit canis, hac lutulenta ruit sus: 75
Ι nunc, et versus tecum meditare canoros.

Scriptorum chorus omnis amat nemus, et fugit urbes,

Rite cliens Bacchi, somno gaudentis et umbra.

Tu me inter strepitus noctumos atque diurnos

Vis canere, et contacta sequi vestigia vatum? 80
Ingenium, sibi quod vacuas desumsit Athenas,

Et studiis annos septem dedit, insenuitque

Libris et curis, statua taciturnius exit

Quirinalis was at the northern extremity of the city, and the Μοπε
Aventinus at the southern. Hence the pleasantry of the expression
which follows: “intervalla humane commocla.’'——70. Intervalla humane
commoda. “ A comfortable distance for a man to walk.”— Verum purae
sunt plateae, &c. The poet here supposes Florus, or some other person,
to urge this in reply: 'Tis true, it is a long way between the, Quirinal
and Aventine, “but then the streets are clear,” and one can meditate
uninterrupted by the way—7⁹2. Festinat calidus mulis yerulz'sque redem-
tor. The poet rejoins: Aye, indeed, the streets are very clear: “A
builder, for instance, in a great heat, hurries along with his mules and
porters.” Calidas may be rendered more familiarly, “ puffing and blow-
ing.'’—Redemtor. By this term is meant a contractor 01· master-builder.
Compare Ode 111. i. 3.5.—7 3. Torquet nunc lapidem, nunc inyens machina
tignum. ‘⁶ Α machine rears at one moment a stone, at another a pon-
derous beam.'' Torquet does not here refer, as some commentators
suppose, to the dragging along of the articles alluded to, but to their ⁴
being raised on high, either by means of a windlass or a combination of
pulleys.———74. Tristia robustis luctantur funera plaustris. Horace else—
where takes notice of the confusion and tumult occasioned at Rome by
the meeting of funerals and waggons. Sat. 1. vi. 42.

78—85. 73. Rite cliens Bacchi. ‘⁶ Due worshippers of Bacchus ;†'
i.e. duly enrolled among the followers of Bacchus. This deity, as
well as Apollo, was regarded as a tutelary divinity of the poets, and
one of the summits of Parnassus was sacred to him—80. Et contacta
sequi vestigia vatum ‚2 “And to tread close in the footsteps of genuine
bards, until I succeed in coming up with them ?'’—81. Ingenium, sibi
quod vacuas desumsz't Athenas. “ A man of genius, who has chosen for
himself the calm retreat of Athens.'' Ingenium quod is here put for
Ingeniosus qui. As regards the epithet vacuas, consult note on Epist.
1. vii, 45. The connexion in the train of ideas should be here aare·
ffllly noted. It had been objected to Horace, that he might very well
