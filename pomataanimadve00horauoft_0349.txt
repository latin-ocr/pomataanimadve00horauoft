SERMONL'M Lm. 1. 4. 309

Di bene fecerunt, inopis mc quodque pusilli
F inxcrunt animi, raro ct perpauca loquentis ;
At tu conclusas hircinis follibus auras,
Usque laborantes, dum ferrum emolliat iguis, 20
Ut mavis, imitare.
Beatus Fannius, ultro
Delatis capsis ct imagine Ξ quum mea nonio
Scripta legat, vulgo recitare timentis, ob hanc rem,
Quod sunt quos genus hoc minime juvat, utpote plures
Culpari dignos. Quemvis media elige turba ; 25
Aut ab avaritia aut misera ambitione laborat.

to stake. Hence the passage may be paraphrased as follows: “ Crispinus
offers to bet with me a hundred to onc.’'—16. Custodes. “ InspectorS,”
to sce that they neither brought with thern verses already composed, nor
such as were the productiori os others—17. D'z‘ benefecerunt, ἃς. The
idea intended to be conwycd is this z Ι will have nothing to do with thy
wager, Crispinus. The gods be praised for having made nic what I am, a
man of moderate powers and rctiring character. Do thou go on, undis-
turbed by any rivalry on my part, with thy turgid and empty versifying.—
Inopis me quodque pusilli, &c. ‘⁴ ln having made me of a poor and
humble mind.'’—l9. At tu conclusas, ἄιε. The order of construction is
as follows : Ac tu imitare, ut mavis, auras conclusas hircinis follibus,
laborantes usque dum iynis emolliat ferrum—20. Usque. “ Con-
stantly.”--2l. Ut mavis. ‘¹ Since thou dost prefer this.”

21—32. 21. Beatus Fannius. “A happy man is Fannius! his
writings and his bust having been carried, without any trouble on his
part, to the public library.'' In rendering ultro, (which is commonly
translated “unasked fors) we have followed the authority of thc scho-
liast: “ Fannius Quadratus, polita malas, cum liberos non haberet.
haeredipetae sine ejus cura et studio (ultro) libros ejus et imayinem
in publicas bibliothecas referebant, nullo tamen merito scriptoris.”
In this way, ultro may have a double meaning: the one mentioned by the
scholiast in relation to the legacy-hunters, and the other slily alluding to
the absence of all mental exertion on thc part of Fannius himself‚'towards
rendering his productione worthy of so high an honour. At Rome, when
a poet had gained for himself a distinguished name among his coutem—
poran'es, his works and his bust were placed in the public libraries.
Fannius, however, lucky man! secures for himself a niche there, without
any trouble on his part, either bodily or meruah—22. Capsis ,- literally,
“ his book-cases.” The capsae were cases or boxes for holding books or
writings. By the use of the term on the present occasion, the poet would
seem to allude to the voluminous nature of the wretched productione of
Fannius.—23. Timentis. The genitive, as in apposition with the per-
sonal pronoun mei, which is implied ir. the possessive mem—24. Genus
hoc. Under-stand scribendi ,· alluding to saum—25. Quemvis media
elige turba. “ Take any one at randum from the midst of the crowd.’'—
28. Hunc capit arqenti splendor, &c. “ This one the glitter of silver
captivates, Albius is lost in admiration of bronze.'' By argenti, vessels
