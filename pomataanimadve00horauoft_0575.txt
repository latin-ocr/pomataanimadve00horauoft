EPISTOLARUM LIB. 1. 18. 19. 533

Me quoties reficit gelidus Digentia rivus,
Quem Mandela bibit, rugosus frigore paguS, 105
Quid sentire putas? quid eredis, amice, precari ἲ
Sit mihi, quod mmo est ; etiam minus .· ec milli viz-am
Quod superest aevi, εἰ quid superesse volunt (Ιὶ .·
Sit bona librorum et provisae fra-‘sis in annum

Sed satis est orare Jocem, quae donat et ausm ‚-
Dec vitam, det opes ; aequum mi animum ipse parabo.

This would have been imprudent and unfair, and contrary also to his
own sentiments of things. His true aim is to persuade him, that if
happiness is to be found only in peaceful retirement, this ought to be
his study even in the exercise of ln's employment. In this way he ta—
citly advises him to moderate his ambition and avarice ; because, in a
retired life, riches and honours are rather a troublesome burden, than
any needful help.

104—111. 104. Diyentia. The Digentia, now the Licenza, was a
stream formed by the Fons Bandusia, and running near the poet's
abode through the territory of Mandela, a small Sabine village in the
vicinity.—-105. Ruqosus friyore payns. “ A village wrinkled with
cold.” The consequence of its mountainous situation—106. Quid
sentire putas? quid credis, amice, precari? With sentire and precari,
respectii'ely, supply me.—107. Sit mihi, quod nune est; etiam minus.
We have here a fine picture of the manner in which Horace sought for
tranquillity. He was so far from desiring more,0that he could be
even satisfied with less. He wanted to live for himself, cultivate his
mind, and be freed from uncertainty.—109. Et provisae sruyis in annum.
“And of the productions of the earth laid up for the year ;'' ξ. e. and
of provisions for a year.—llO. Nezcstzcitem dubiae spe pendulus horae.
“And let me not fluctuate in suspense as regards the hope of each
uncertain hour ;'’ i. e. and let me not fluctuate between hope and sear,
filled with anxious thoughts as regards the uncertain events of the
’ future.—-lll. Sed satis est orare Jovem, quae donat et aufert,&c. Horace
distinguishes between the things we ought to hope for from the gods,
and those we are to expect only from ourselves. Life and riches
depend, according to the poet, upon the pleasure of Jove, but an equal
mind upon our own exertions. .
