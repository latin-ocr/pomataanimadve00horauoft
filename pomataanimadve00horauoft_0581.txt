suppose, that the allusio: 1 11010 13 to the Roman custom of not rm 1011
locking, but also of sealing, the doors of the apartments in which their
children were kept, that 110 persons, who might be suspected of cor-

small compass ;'‘ i. e. art getting rolled up close, to be laid by. The
poet threatens his book, that it shall be rolled up, as if condemned never
to be read again. The books of the ancients were written on skins of
parchment, which they were obliged to unfold and extend when they
designed to read them. Plenus quum languet emmor. The lover here
signifies a passionate reader who seizes a book with rapture ; runs over
it in haste, · his curiosity begins to bc satisfied ; his appetite is cloyed ;
he throws it 31131, and never opens it again. —9. Quid si non odio
peccantis desipit augur. “But if the augur, 0who now addresses thee,
13 not deprived of his better judg, rment by indignation at thy folly;”

i. e. if the anger which I now feel at thy rash and foolish conduct,
does not so inflouence my mind as to (1130113111)ν me from foreseeing and

youth shall have 10st thee ;'' ι’. e. as long 33 thou retainest the charms
