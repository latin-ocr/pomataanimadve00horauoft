where they sell ;“” literally‚ “into the street that sells'' The Vicus
'Ihur'arius 1s meant —21 Ὀ. Chartis ineptis. The allusion is to writings
so foolish aud unworthy of perusal, as soon to find their way to the
groeers, and subserve the humbler but more useful employmeut of
uraupers for small purchases.

EPISTLE IL-This Epistle is also in some degree critical. Julius
Florus, a friend of our poet's, on leaving Rome to attend Tiberius in
one of his military expeditioris, asked Horace to send him some lyric
poems ; and wrote to him afterwards, complaining of his neglect. The
poet offers various excuses. One of these arose from the multitude of
bad and conceited poets with which the capital swarmed. Accordingly
his justification is enlivened with much raillery on the vanity of con-
temporary authors, and their insipid compliments to each other, while
the whole is animated with a fine spirit of criticism‚ and with valuable
preeepts for our instruction in poema-This has been parodied by
Pope in the same style as the preceding epistle.

1—9. l. F lore. To this same individua1‚ who formed part of the
retinue of Tiberius, the third Epistle of the first Book is inscribed.—
Neroni ; alluding to Tiberius (Claudius Tiberius Nero) the future
emperor.——3. Gabiis. Consult note on Epist. 1. xi. 7.-Ετ tecum sic
agat. ‘⁴ And should ‘creat with thee as follows.”—Hic et candidas, et
talos ιι vertice, &c. “ This boy is both fair aud handsome from head to
foot.'' Candidus does not here refer to the mind, as some commenta·
tors suppose, but to the complexion 3 and the allusion appears to be
a general one, to the bright look of health which the slave is said to
have, and which would form so important a feature in the enumeration
of his good qualities.—5. Fiet eritque tuus. ‘⁶ He shall become, and
shall be, thine.” An imitation of the technical language of a bargain.
—Nummorum millibus octo. “For eight thousand sesterces.” — 6.
Ver-na ministeriis ad nutus aptus heriles. ‘⁶ A slave ready in his services
at his master’s nod 3’' z'. e. prompt to understand and obey every nod of
his master. Ver-ruz, which is here used in a general sense for servus,
properly denotes a slave born beneath the roof of his masten—7. Lite-
rulis Graecis imbutus. “ Having some little knowledge of Greek.”
This would enhance his value, as Greek was then much spoken at
