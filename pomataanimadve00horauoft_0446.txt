404 Q. IIOR-ATII FLAGCI

HORATIUS.
Peccatum fateor, quum te sic tempore laevo

Interpellarim: secl des veniam bonus, oro.
Quod si interciderit tibi nunc aliquid, repetes mox,
Sive est naturae hoc, sive artis, mirus utroque.

CATIUS.

CATIUS.
Ipsa memor praecepta canam, celabitur auctor.

Ponere 3 namque marem cohibent callosa vitellum.

cepts in question are such as have never before been made known.—3.
Anytique reum. “And him who was accused by Anytus ;'' ἱ. e. So-.
crates, in the number of whose accusers was Anytus. This individual

8—14. 8. Quin id efflat curae, ἃς. “Why‚ I was just then con—
sidering how I might retain them all in mind, as being nice matters,
and expressed in nice language.''—lO. Hominis. The individual who
uttered these precepts to Catius—ll. Celabz'tur auctor. The poet
evidently had some person in view, to whom all could make the applica-
tion, even though his name was kept back. It was most probably some
man of rank, whom he did not wish openly to provoke.-——l2. Longa
quibus facies ovis erit, &c. “Remember to serve up those eggs which
shall have a long shape‚ as being of a better taste, and more nutritious,
than the round.” Catius preserves a regular order in delivering his

remarks with some general reflections upon neatness and elegance.
The Roman entertainments‚ it will be recollected, always commenced
with eggs. Consult note on Sat. Ι. iii. 6.——14. Namque marem cohibent
callosa vitellum. ‘⁶ For they have a thicker white, and contain a male
