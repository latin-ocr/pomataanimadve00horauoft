SATIRA II.
IN VITAE URBANAE LUXURIAM ET INEPTIAS.

QUAE virtus, et quanta, boni, sit vivere parvo,

brought.” In the law, as here cited by Trebatius, mala means ‘⁶ libel-
lous‚” “ slanderous,” &c. 3 but Horace, having no serious answer to
make, pretends to take it in the sense of “ badly-made,” and hence he
rejoins, Eslo, si quis mala; secl bona si quis, &c.-86. Solventw· risu

Sume IL—This Satire, on the luxury and gluttony of the Romans,
is put into the mouth of a Sabine peasant, whom Horace calls Ofellus,
and whose plain good sense is agreeably contrasted with the extrava-
gance and folly of the great. He delivers rules of temperance with the
utmost ease and simplicity of manner, and thus bestows more truth and
liveliness on the pictures, than if Horace (who was himself known to
frequent the luxurious tables of the patricians) had inculcated the moral
precepts in his own person.

cheerfully upon little.” 2. Nec meus hic sermo est. Compare Intro-
ductory Remarks.—3. Abnormis sapiens, crassaque Illinerva. “ A
philosopher without mles, and of strong, rough common sense.” The
expression abnormis sapiens is here used to denote one* who was a fol-
lower of no sect, and derived his doctrines and precepts from no rules of
philosophising as laid down by others, but who drew them all from his
own breast, and was guided by his own convictions respecting the fitness
or unfitness of things. The phrase crassa Minerva is meant to desig-
nate one who has no acquaintance with philosophieal subtleties or the
precepts of art, but is swayed by the dictates and suggestions of plain,
native sense—4. sssensasqzae nitentes. “And glittering tables ;” ἱ. ε.
