Cum pulchris tunicis sumet nova consilia et spes ;
Dormiet in lucem 3 scorto postponet honestum
Officium ; nummos alienos pascet 3 ad imum 35
Threx erit, aut olitoris aget mercede caballum.
Arcanum neque tu scrutaberis illius unquam,

N ec tua laudabis studia, aut aliena reprendes 3

Lenibus imperiis; quotiesque educet in agros 45
Aetolis onerata plagis jumenta canesque,

men's money ;” i. e. he will borrow money and squander it away in
luxurious and riotous living—36. Threx erit. ‘⁶ He will turn gladiator.”

Gratia sic fratrum yemfflorum, «Sec. “ Thus the fn'endship of the twin-
brothers Amphion and Zethus was broken, until the lyre, disliked by
the latter, who was rugged in manners, became silent.'' Amphion and
Zethus were sons of Jupiter and Antiope, and remarkable for their dif-
ferent tempers. Amphion was fond of music, and Zethus took delight
in tending flocks. But as Zethus was naturally of a rugged disposition,
