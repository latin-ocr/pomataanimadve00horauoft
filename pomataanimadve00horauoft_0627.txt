EPlSTOLARUM Lm. 11. -3, 585

Sunt qui non habeant, est qui non curat habere.

Cur alter fratrum cessare et ludere et ungi

‚Praeferat Herodis palmetis pinguibus 3 alter,

Dives et importunus, ad umbram lucis ab ortu 185
Silvestrem flammis et ferro mitiget agrum,

Scit Genius, natale comes qui temperat astrum,

Naturae deus humanae, mortalis in unum-

Quodque caput, vultu mutabilis, albus et ater.

purple.’' By vestes are here meant the coverings of couches (vestes
εἰναριιίαε), and hangings for the walls of banqueting-rooms, occ. peri-
petasmata.)—Gaetul0 murice. Gaetulia, a part of Africa, is here put for
the whole country. Consult note on Ode 1. xxiii. 10, and, as regards
the purple here spoken of, Ode 11. xvi. :za—132. Est qui non curat
habere. To show how unnecessary these things are, the poet says there
are many people who never give themselves any trouble or concern
about them. The indicative after est qui is an imitation of the Greek
idiom.

183—189. 183. Cur alter fratrum cessare, &a The connexion in the
train of ideas is as follows: Tne dispositions of men are widely at
variance with each other 3 and this discrepancy shows itself even in the
case of brothers ; for it often happens that one is a careless and effemi-
nate prodigal, the other a close and toiling miser. Why this is so, is a
secret known only to the Genius who presides at our birth, and guides
the course of our existence-..Cessare et ludere et unyi. The inflnitives
here must be rendered in our idiom by nouns: “ Ease and pleasure
and perfilmes.''-184. Herodis palmetis pinyaibus. ‘⁶ To the rich palm-
groves of Herod.‘' These were in the country around Je1icho‚ and
were regarded as constituting some of the rit-hest possessions of the
Jewish monarch.—185. Importunas. “ Morose.'¹-—Ad umbram lacis ab
ortu. ‘⁴ From the daim of day to the shades of evening.''—186. Silves-
trem. “Overrun with underwood.'’—Miti9et. Subdues, i. e. clears,
and renders productiva—187. Scit Genius, natale comes qui temperat
astrum, &c. This is generally regarded as the loeus classicus respecting
the ideas entertained by the ancients relative to what they considered
the Genius of each indiw'dual. We leam from it the following parti-
culars: 1. The Genius was supposed to accompany a person wherever
he went. 2. He governed the horoscope of the party (natale temperavit
astrum), exerting himself to avert any ⁴evil which one’s natal star might
portend, or to promote any good which it might indicate. 3. He is
styled, “Naturae deus humanae,” because he lives and dies with us. 4.
Heis angry if we oppose or resist his influence, but mild and gentle if
we submit to his sway (mutabilis, albas et ater ).—Natale comes qai tem-
perat astrum. “ Our constant attendant, who governs our horoscope.'’—
188. Naturae deus humanae, mortalis, &c. “ The god of human nature,
who dies with each individual ; mutable of aspect, benign or offended.''
The expression mortalis in unumquodque caput, is added by the poet for
the purpose of explaining the words naturae deus humanae; i. e. the god
who, equally with man, is subject to the power of death—189. Vultu
mutabilis, albus et'ater. Compare note on verse 187, toward the end.
