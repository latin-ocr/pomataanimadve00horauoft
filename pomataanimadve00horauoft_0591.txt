Accius alti. “ Pacuvius bears away the character of a skilful veteran,
Accius of a losty writer.” With alti supply poetae. The term senis
characterizes Pacuvius as a literary veteran, a title which he well
deserved, since he published his last piece at the age of eighty, niul
died after having nearly completed his ninetieth year. As regards the
epithet docti, it must be borne in mind, that the reference here is not to
learning, as some pretend, but to skill in the dramatic conduct of the
scene.—57. Dicitur Afrani toya convenisse Menandro. “ The gown of
Afranius is said to have fitted Menander.” An expression of singular
felicity‚ and indicating the closeness with which Afranius, according
to the critics of the day, imitated the manner and spirit of the Attio
Menander. The term toy-a is here employed in allusion to the subjecta
of Afianffis’swomedies, which were formed on the manners and customs
of the Romans, and played in Roman dresses. His pieces therefore
would receive the appellation of comoediae (or fabulae) toyatae ; asthose
founded on Grecian manners, and played in Grecian dresses, would be
styled palliatae.——58. Plautus ad exemplar Siculi properare Epicharmi.
“ Plautus to hurry onward aster the pattern of the Sicilian Epicharmus.”
The true meaning of properare, in this passage, has been misunderstood
by some commentator& It refers to the particular genius of Plautus,
whose pieces are full of action, movement, and spirit. The incidente
never flag, but rapidly accelerate the catastrophe. At the same time,
however, it cannot be denied, that if we regard his plays in the mass,
there is a considerable, and perhaps too great uniformity in their fables.
This failing, of course, his admireis overlooked.
