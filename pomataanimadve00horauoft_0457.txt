Infantes statuas, seu pingui tentus omaso 40

Plures annabunt thunni, et cetaria crescent.

follows: “Jupiter hibernas cana nive conspuit Alpes-'’-4Q Omaso.

The term onmsmn properlv denotcs a bulloek’s paunch: it is herc
xlominal rotundity of Furius himself.—

humorously applied to the* al
s! nt acer! “How indefatigable he is!

43. Ut patiens! nt amicis aptit
how scrviceable to his friends l how warni in their cause !”—44. Plures

«innabant thuani, et cetaria crescent. ‘⁶ More- tunnies will swim in, and
thy fish-ponds will increase.'' The thuanus of the ancients is the scom-
ber thuanus of modern ichthyologists. These fish always swim in great
numbers ; and from this circumstance the present image is drawn, rich
old men being here compared to so many tunnies swimming in shoals
into the net of the legacy-hunter.-Cetaria. The cetaria were flsh-
ponds of salt water, near the sea-side, intended for the larger kind of

fisis—54. 45. Validus male. “In soemo health.”—46. samatus

aletur. ‘⁶ Shall be rearcd ;” literally, ‘⁶ shall be taken up and nurtureds’
The term sublatus has reference here to the Roman custom of listing a
new-bom infant from the ground. This was done either by the father,
or, in his absence, by some friend authorizcd to act for him, and was

equivalent to an acknowledgment of the child's legitimaey. Hence the
phrases “tollere filium,'' to raise or educate a son, and “non ωηεν-ρξ’

to expose.-—Ne manifestum caelibis obsequium, Sec. ‘⁵ Lest too open
courting of a single man may cxpose thee ;’' i. e. may lay open the real
motive that actuates thee. caelebs does not merely denote a bachelor,
but a single man generally, and hence is sometimes, as in the present
instance, used to signify a widonen—47. Leniter in spem arrepe ‹fficio-
ms, διε. “ Creep gently, by thy assiduities, into the hope of both being
written in his will as second heir, and, if any chance shall have driven
the boy to the shadeS, of coming into possession of the vacant inherit-
ance. This game very rarely faiis.”—48. Secundus heres. A second
heir was sometimes named in wills, who was to succeed to the property
if the heir or heirs first appointed did not choose to accept, or died under
age.—49. Si quis casus puerum egerit Orco ,· equivalent to, “ si fortc
