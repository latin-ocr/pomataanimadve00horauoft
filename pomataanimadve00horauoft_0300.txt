260 Q. HoRA'rn FLAcc1

Pocula Lethaeos ut si ducentia somnos
Arente fauce traxerim,

Candide Maecenas, occidis saepe rogando ε 5
Deus, deus nam me vetat

Inceptos, olim promissum carmen, iambos
Ad umbilicum adducere.

Non aliter Samio dicunt arsisse Bathyllo
Anacreonta Teium 3 10

Qui persaepe cava testudine flevit amorem,
Non elaboratum a’d pedem.

Ureris ipse miser ! quod si non pulchrior ignis
Accendit obsessam Ilion,

Gaude sorte tua 3 me libertina, neque uno 15
Contenta, Phryne macerat.

8. Ad umbilicum adducere. “ To bring to an end.’' Among the Romans,
when a book or volume was finished it was rolled around a taper stick,
made ofwedar, box, ivory, or the like, and called umbilicus from its
being in the middle when the work was rolled around it. The 'poets
generally use the plural form of this word, in allusion to the parts
which projected on either side of the book: the two extremities were
called cornua. Some, however, suppose that by umbilici are meant
bans or besses, placed at either end of the stick. whatever the true
solution of this point may be, for it is certainly involved in some doubt,

same, viz. ‘⁴ to bring to an end,'' “ to finish‚⁷' δια-12. Νοη elaboratum
ad pedem. “ In careless measure.”—l3. Quod si non pulchrior ignis,
