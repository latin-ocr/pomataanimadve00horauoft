DAMASIPPL'S.
Postquam omnis res mea ,Janum

Ad medium fracta est, aliena negotia curo,
Excussus propriis, Olim nam quaerere amabam, ‘20

Quo vafer ille pedes lavisset Sisyphus acre,
Quid sculptum infabre, quid fusum durius esset:
Callidus huic signo ponebam millia centum :

Hortos egregiasque domos mercarier unus
Cum lucro noram ; unde frequentia Mercuriale 25

17-25. 17. Donent tonsore. Horace pretends not to bc awarc
that Damasippus is a philosopher, and therefore nourishes a length of
beard, but charitably wishes him a barber, who may remove from his
chin its unseernly covering‚ to the uncouth appearance of which the
want of personal cleanliness had, no doubt, largely contributed.——18.
Postquam omnis res mea Janum, ἃς. “ After all my fortunes were
shipwrecked at the middle Janus.”--Janum ad medium. By this is
meant what we would term in modern parlance “the exchangc.” In
the Roman Forum, besides the temple of J anus there were three arches
or arcades dedicated to this god, standing at some distance apart, and
forming by their line of direction a kind of street, as it were3 for,
strictly speaking, there were no streets in the Forum. The central one
of these arches was the usual rendezvous of brokers and money-lenders,
and was termed mediusJanuss—-while the other two were denominated,
from their respective positions, summus Janus, and infimus or imus
Janus. Damasippus speaks of himself as having become bankrupt at
the middle one of these—19. Aliena negotia curo, excussus propriis.
“ Ι attend to the concerns of other people, being completely detached
from any of my own ;” Le. having none of my own to occupy me.—20.
Olim nam quaerere amabam, ἃς. With quaerere supply aes. The
allusion here is to vessels of bronze3 and Damasippus, describing the
line of employment which he had pursued up to his bankruptey, makes
himself out to have been what we would term a virtuoso, and a dealer in
antiques—21. Quo vafer ille pedes, ἃς. Sisyphus was the most crasty
chiestain of the heroic age. A bronze rossel as old as his time would
meet with many sad unbelievers among thecommon herd of mem—22.
Insabre. “ With inferior ski11.”—Durias. “ In too rough a mould.''
This term is directly opposed to mollius.—‘.23. Callidus huic signo, διο.
“ Being a connoisseur in such things, I estimated this statue at a hun-
dred thousand sesterces.” With millia centum supply sestertium or
nummum. As regards the use of the verb pono in this passage, com-
pare the analogous expression ponere pretium, to estimate, or set a
value upon—25. C‘um lucro. “ At a bargain.”—Unde frequentia
Mercuriale, ἃς. “ Whence the crowds attending auction in the public
streets gave me the surname of Mercury's favourite.”—Frequentia
comptus,- literally, “the crowded streets.” The allusion, however, is
to the crowds attending sales at auction in the public streets. Dama-
sippus, a profaesed connoisseur, made it a point to attend every sale of

this kind, however low, in the hope of picking up bargairm.
