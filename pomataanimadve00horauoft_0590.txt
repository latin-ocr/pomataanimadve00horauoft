548 Q. HORATII IsLACCI

Paulatim vello, et demo unum, demo et item unum,

Dum cadat elusus ratione ruentis acervi,
Qui redit in fastos, et virtutem aestimat annis,
Miraturque nihil, nisi quod Libitina sacravit.
Ennius, et sapiens et fortis, et alter Homerus, 50
Ut critici dicunt, leviter curare videtur,
Quo promissa cadant et somnia Pythagorea.
Naevius in manibus non est, et mentibus haeret
Paene recens? adeo sanctum est vetus omne poema.

ceding of the first, which in general cannot be withheld, (lraws after it
a concession of all the rest in their respective turns, until our antago-
nist finds himself driven into a situation from which there is no escape:
As a heap of corn, for example, from which one grain after another is
con inually taken, at length sinks to the ground, so, 111 the present in-
stance, a large number of years, from which a single one is constantly
taken, 13 at last so diminished that we cannot tell when it ceased to be
3 large number. Chrysippus was remarkable foi his frequent use of
this syllogism,and' 13 supposed to have been the 1111 emtor—46. Paulatim
vello, et demo unum, demo etitem unum. With vello supply annos, and
with each unum supply unumne—47. Cadat. As if he had been stand-
ing on the heap, in fancied security‚ until the removal of one of its
component parts after another brings him eventually to the ground.—
49. Nisi quod Libitina sacravit; alluding to the works of those who
have been consigned to the tomb—the writings of former days. Consult
as regards Libitina, the note on Ode 111. xxx. 7

50—53. 50. Ennius, et sapiens et fortis, Sec. “Ennius. both
learned and spirited, and a second Homer, as crities say, seems to care
but little what becomes of his boastful promises aud his Pythagorean
dreams.'' Thus far the poet has been combating the general prejudice
of his time 111 favour of antiquity. He now enters into the particulars
of his charge, and, from line 50 to 59, gives us a detail of the judg-
ments passed upon the most celebrated of the old Roman poets by the
generality of his contemporaries. As these judgments are only a
representation of the popular opinion, not of the writer's own, the
commendatioris here bestowed are deserved or otherwise, just 33 it
chances. Horace commences with Ennius: the meaning, however, which
he intends to 00111οΥ 1133 been in general not 1011 clearly understood.
Ennius particularly professed to have imitated Homer, and tried to
persuade his countrymen, that the soul and genius of that great poet
had revived 111 111111, through the medium of a peacock, according to the
process of Px thagorean transmigration: a fantas’tic genealogy to which
Persius alludes (6. 10. seqq.) Hence the boastful promises (promissa)
of the old bard, that he would pour forth strains worthy of the F ather
of Grecian song. The fame of Ennius, however, observes Horace,is 2
now completely established among the critics of the day, and he appears Δ
to be perfectly at ease with regard to his promises and 1113 (11031110
(leviter curare videtur, quo promissa cadant, 810.) Posterity,' 111 their
blind admiration, 11310 made him all that he professed to be. —53. Nae-
