46 8 Q. HORATII FLACCI

An tragica desaevit et ampullatur in arte ἲ

Quid mihi Celsus agit? monitus multumque monendus, 15
Privatas ut quaerat opes, et tangere vitet

Scripta, Palatinus quaecunque recepit Apollo 3

Ne, si forte suas repetitum venerit olim

Grex avium plumas5* moveat cornicula risum

Fui-tivis nudata coloribus. Ipse quid audes? 20
Quae circumvolitas agilis thyma? non tibi parvum
Ingenium, non incultum est et turpiter hirtum.

Seu linguam causis acuis, seu civica jura

Respondete paraS, seu condis amabile carmen:

Prima feres ederae victricis praemia. Quod si 25

is he 5³⁹⁹—F2'd2busne Latinis Thebanos, διας alluding to his imitation of
Pindar‚ a native of Thebes, in Latin verse—13. Auspice Effusa. ‘⁶ Un-
der the favouring auspices of the Muse.''—l4. An trayica desaevit et
ampullatur in arte? ‘⁴ Or does he rage and swell in tragic strains ἴ·”
Horace, while he praises his friend Titius, appears at the same time, from
the lang-uage of the text, especially from the irony implied in am-
pullatur, to designate him as a turgid poet.

15-«20. 15. Quid milzz' Celsus agit? ‘⁶ What is my Celsus doing ‚⁹³³
The pronouns mihi, tihi, sibi, nobi-5¹, vobis, are osten used in this way,
with the force of possessives, and in imitation of the Greek idiom. This
is osten done for the purpose of gentle sarcasm, as in the 'present in-
stance. The individual here alluded to is generally supposed to have
been the same with Celsus Albinovanus, to whom the eighth epistle of
this book is inscribed. He appears to have been addicted to habits of
plagiarism.—16. Privatas opes. “ Treasures of his own.” Opes here
applies to the literary resources of iudividuals.—l7. Palatinus Apollo ‚·
an allusion to the Palatine library, where the writings of the day, if
useful or valuable, were treasured up along with the productioris of other
nations and times. The Palatine librar-y was founded by Augustus
A. U. C. 726. It was connected with the temple of Apollo on the
Palatine hill, and was filled with the works of the best Greek and Latin
authors—19. Cornicula. Supply sicuti. The allusion is to the well—
known fable of AEsop, excepting that, for the more common term yracu-
las, we have here cornicula-20. Furi-ivis nudata coloribus. ‘⁶ Stripped
of its stolen colours ;” i. e. stripped of the feathers of the peacock,
which it had assumed for its own. ’

21—28. 21. Ayz'lis. ‘⁶ Like the industrious bee.'' Horace, on a
former occasion, has compared himself to the same little creature. (Ode
IV. ii. 27.)-·2·2. Non incultum est et turpiter hirtum. “ It is not urr-
cultivated and shamefully rough.'' The mental powers, in their neglected
state, are aptly compared to a field left without culture, and rough with
briers and thorus—⁵23. Seu linquam causis acuis. “ Whether thou art
sharpening thy tongue for causes ;” ἱ. e. training thyself for public
speaking—Civica jara respondere. “ To give answers on points of (3ἰῶ
law.”—24. Amahile carmen. ‘⁶ The pleasing strain.”—25. Prima sesae
