SATIRES.

ΟΝ ROMAN SATIRE.

Tus: scholars of earlier days were accustomcd to dispute‚ with no little
degree of ardour, on the origin of Roman Satire, as well as on the meaning
of the term by which this specics of composition is wont to be designated.
The Abbe Garnier defines a Satire to be a poem without any regular
action, of a certain length, either indulging in invective, or of an ironical
character, and directed against the vices and the failings of men with a
view to their correction. Was satire, regarded in this light, an invention
of the Romans, or did they, in this bianch of literature, as in almost every
other, merely follow in the path of some Grecian original? Julius Sca-
liger, Daniel Heinsius, and Spannheim, have maintained the latter opinion,
in opposition to Horace and Quintilian, whose authority has been sup-
ported and defended by Casaubon. The whole controversy, however,
proved eventually‚ like so many others of a similar nature, only a disputo
about words, and it ceasedbthe moment the subject was clearly understood.
Dacier‚ Koeuig, and other wn'ters are entitled, after Casaubon, to tho
merit of having cleared up the question to such a. degree as to render any
fax-ther discussion unnecessary.

We must, above all things, guard against confounding together two
ter-ms which have an accidental resemblance in form, but quite different
etymologies, the Greek Satyre and the Roman Satire. The former was
a species of jocose drama, in which Satyrs were made to play the pn'ncipal
part, and hence the appellation which it received. ive have but one
piece of this kind remaining,—the “ Cyclops'' of Eun'pides. On the other
hand, the Roman Satire, the invention of which is ascribed by the ancient
writers to Ennius, differed from the-§jtylje of the Greeks, in that, being
without a plot, and embracing no regular and continued action, it was
intended sor the closet‚ not for the stage. This Satire was neither a
drama, an epic poem, nor a lyric effusion. Neither was it a didactic
piece, in the strict sense of the word, according to which adidactic poem
is taken to signify a production in verse, which developes not a single
truth, hut a system of truths‚ or rather a doctrine, and not in a transitory
manner or by way of digression, but with method and formal reasoning.
The ancients regarded each species of verse as belonging peculiarly to one
particular kind of poetry. Thus the Hexameter was reserved sor epic and
didactic poems; the Hexameter and pentameter, alternately succeeding
each other, were employed in elegiae effusions3 the Iambic was used in
dramatic compositions3 while the different Lyric- measures were devoted
to the species of poetry which bore that name. Now, the Satire of
Ennius deviated from this rule, in excluding none of these several
meti-es. All rhythmis suited it equally well, and the old poet employed
them all in tlTeir turn. It is from this medley of verses, thus employed,
that the name of ,Satires (Satirae) was given to these productioris of
Ennius. Among the Romans, a platter or basin, filled with all sorts of
