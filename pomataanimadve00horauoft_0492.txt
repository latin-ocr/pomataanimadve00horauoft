EPISTOLA
AD MAECENATEM.

PRIMA dicte mihi, summa dicende Camena,
Spectatum satis, et donatum jam rude, quaeris,
Maecenas, iterum antiquo me includere ludo ’ἐ

prsm: I.—This epistle, addressed to Maecenas, contains the poet's
excuse for the inactivity into which he had fallen since the publication of
his third book of Odes. Three years had elapsed without any new work
of the bard's having made its appearance, an interval which had been
spent by him in the calm enjoyment of existence. The contrast that
presents itself between his omi mode of thinking, and the folly of those
who run on in the pursuit of the gifts of fortune and the favours of the
great, constitutes the principal charin of the piece.

1—3. l. Prima dicte mihi, διο. “ Maecenas, subject of my earliest,
that hast a right to be the subject of my latest muse, dost thou seek to
shut me up once more in the old place of exercise‚ after having been
tried sufficiently, and when now gifted with the rod ?'' The name of
his patron stands at the head of the Odes, Epodes, and Satires, as it
does here at the commencement of the Epistles.-2. Spectatum satis.
The poet compares himself to a gladiator, who has been sufficiently
tried in exhibitions of skill, and has at last received his dismissal by
the favour of the people-Donatum rude. Gladiators, when discharged
from fighting, received a rod, 01· wooden sword, as a mark of their ex-

emption. This was either obtained at the expiration of the years of ⁴ ¹

service for which they had engaged, or was granted by the person who
exhibited them, (ermom) at' the desire of the people, to an old gladiator,
or even to a novice, for some uncommon act of courage. Those who
received it (rude donati) were called Rudiarz’z', and suspended their
armS‚ as an offering, at the entrance of the temple of Hercules. They
could not again be compelled to fight, but were sometimes induced by
great hire once more to appear in public and engage.—3. Antiqua ludo.
The reference is to the school or place where the gladIators were exer-
