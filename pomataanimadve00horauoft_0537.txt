EPISTOLARUM Lm. 1. ιο. 495

Quam quae per pronum trepidat cum murmure rivum ἓ

Nempe inter varias nutritur silva columnas,

Laudaturque domm, longos quae prospicit agros.

Naturam expelles furca, tamen usque recurret,

Et mala perrumpet furtim fastidia victrix. 25
Non, qui Sidonio contendere callidus ostro

Nescit Aquinatem potantia vellera fucum,

streets of the city. VVater was brought to Rome both in aqueducts and
leaden pipes. The latter, however. were principally employed in distri-
buting it throughout the city, aster it had been conveyed thither by t‘he
former ; for, in truth, no pipc could have supported the weight of water
brought to the city in the aqueducts.—-·21. Quam quae per pronum, διο.
“ Than that which runs murmuring along its sloping channcl.”—‘2·2,
Nempe inter varias. &e The connexion in the trajn of ideas is as
follows: They who dwell in cities endeavour, it is true, to procure 1¹01·
themselves, by means of art, the beauty and the enjoymcnt of rural
scenes. “ F or example, a wood is reared ami'd columns of variegated
marble, and that abode is praised which commands a prospectos distant
fields ;'’ yet nature, though men strix-e to expcl her by violence, will as
osten return, and will insensibly triumph over all their unreasonable dis-
gusts. As regards the expression inter varias nutritur silua columnas,
consult note on Ode 111. x. 5.—·24. Naturam eoepelles furca. By natura
is here meant, that relish for the pleasures of a rural life which has been
implanted by nature in the breast of all, though weakened in many by
the force of habit or education. This natural feeling, says the poet: can
never entirely be emdicated, but must eventually triumph over every
obstacle. The expression expelles furca is metaphorical, and refers to
the driving away by violence. lt appears to be a mode of speaking
derived from the manner of rustics, who arm and defend themselves ,with
forks, or remove, by means of the same instrument, whatever opposes
them.—-·'.‘5. ,ἲῙαΙα fastidia ,- alluding to those unreasonable disgusts
which keep away the rich and luxurious from the calm and simple enjoy-
ments of a country life.

26—27. 26. Non, qui Sidonio, ἃς. Horace compares the taste of
nature to the true purple, and that of the passions to an adulterated and
counterfeit purple. The man, he observes, who cannot distinguish be-
tween what is true and what is false, will as surely injure himself, as the
merchant who knows not the difference between the genuine purple and
that which is the reversa—Sidonio. Sidon was a famous commercial
city, the capital of Phoenicia, about twenty-four miles north of Tyre, which
was one of its colomes.—-C'‹mtendr·re callidus. “ Skilfully to compare.”
People who compare pieces of stuff together, stretclz them out near each
other, the better to discern the difference.—·27. Aquinatem potantia
vellera sucum. ‘⁶ The fleeces that drink the dye of Aquinum.'' Accord-
ing ιο the scholiast, a purple was manufactured at Aquinum in imitation
of the Phccnician. Aquinum was a city of the Volsci, in new Latium,
situate a little beyond the place where the Latin Way crossed the rivers
Liris and Melfis.—-Fucum. Consult note on Ode 111. v. 23.
