EPISTULARUM Lm. 1. 7. 488

Haec seges ingratos tulit, et feret omuibus annis.

Vir bonus et sapiens dignis ait esse paratus,

Neo tamen ignorat, quid distent aera lupinis.

Dignum praestabo me etiam pro laude merentis.

Quod si me noles usquam discedere, reddes 25
Forte latus, nigros angusta fronte capillos,

Reddes dulce loqui, reddes ridere decorum, et

beniyne were terms of politeness among the Romans, as καλῶς and
ἐπαινῶ among the Greeks, when they refused any thing offered to them.
-21, Haec seyes inyratos tulit, exc. ‘⁴ This soil has produced, and ever
will produce, ungrateful men ;” i. e. this liberality has had, and iu all
ages will have, ingratitude for its certain crop. A foolish and un-
meaning prodigality deserves no better return 3 for acknowledgment
ought always to be in proportion to the benefit received, and what is
given in this manner is not worthy the name of a beneflt.—2·2. Vir
bonus et sapiens cliym's ait esse paratus. ‘⁴ A good and wisc man says that
he is ready for the deserving ;” i. e. professes himself ready to confer
favour-s on those who deserve them. The allusion in virbonus el sapiens
is to Maecenas. We have here an elegant imitation, iu paratus, of the
Greek construction, by which a nominative is joined with the infinitive
whenever the reference is to the same person. Thus the expression
in the text, if converted into Greek, would be, ὁ καλὸς κᾴγαθὸς τοῖς
ἀξίοις φησὶν εἶναι πρόθυμος. The common Latin structure requires
se paratum essa—23. Nec tamen iynorat, quid distent (zera lupinis. “And
yet is not ignorant how true money differs from lupincs.” The players
upon the stage were accustomed to make use of lupines instead of real
coin, (compare Muretus, ad Plaut. Poen. 111. ii. 20,) and so also boys at
their gameS. Hence, when the poet states, that the good and wise
man can distinguish well between true coin and that which players use
upon the stage or boys at their gameS, he means to convey the idea,
that such a man knows what he gives, that he can tell whether it be of
value or otherwise, whether it be suitable or unsuitable to him on whom
it is conferred.—-·24. Dignum praestabo me etiam pro laude merentis.
“ I, too, as the praise of my benefactor demands, will show myself wor-
thy of the gifts that I have received ;'’ i. e. I will show myself worthy
of what my generous patron has bestowed upon me, that he may enjoy
the praise of having conferred his savours on a desening object.—-‘25.
Usquam discedere. ‘¹ To go anywhere from thee 3⁹1⁶. e. to leave thy
society and Roma-26. Forte latus. ‘⁴ My former vigour.” Latus and
latera are frequently used in the Latin writers to indicate strength of
body, as both corporeal vigour and decay show themselves most clearly
in that part of the human frama—⁶26. Niyros angusta fronte capillos.
“ The black locks that once shaded my narrow forehead.” As regards
the estimation in which low foreheads were held among 'the Greeks
and Romans as a mark of beauty, consult note on Ode 1. xxidii. 5. In the
present mse, the reference would seem to be to the hair’s being worn
so low down as almost to cover the forehead.—27. Dulce loqui. “ My
former powers of pleasing converse.”-—Ridere decorum, “ The becoming
