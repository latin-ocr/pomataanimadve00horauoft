Gloria quem supra vires et vestit et ungit,

Quem tenet argenti sitis importuna famesque,

Quem paupertatis pudor et fuga, dives amicus,

Saepe decem vitiis instructior, odit et horret : 25
Aut, si non odit, regit 3 ac, veluti pia mater,

Plus quam se sapere et virtutibus esse priorem

’ΖΙ-26. 21. Quem damnosa Venus, quem praeceps alea nudat. “ The
man whom ruinous licentiousness, whom the dice, fraught with rapid
destruction, strips of what he has.'' The poet now enters upon an
enumeration of those vices, frorn which he who seeks the favour of the
great and powerful should be free. -24. Paupertatis pudor et fuya. ‘⁴ A
shame of, and aversion for narrow mez31ns '⁹ i. e. a dread of narrow
meanS, and an anxious care to avoid thena-— 25. Saepe decem vitiis
instructior. “Though not unfrequently ten times more wcious3 ’⁷ equi-
valent in effect to saepe decies vttiosior. This precept is of great im-
portance, observes Sanadon. A prince, or powerful person, however
vieious himself, pays a secret homage to virtue, and treats with just
contempt those faults in others which render him really contemptible.
He requires a regularity of conduct, which he breaks by his own ex—

Reyz't. “ Gives him mles for his conduct.”-—Ac, velati pia mater, ὅτε.
The idea intended to be conveyed is this: And, as an affectionate
mother wishes that her offspring may be wiser and better than herself,
so the patron wishes that his dependant may be wiser and more virtuous
than he is. .

28—35. 28. Et ait probe vera.- ‘⁶ And he says truly enough.'⁵-—-
Meae stultitiam patiuntur opes, διο. “ My riches allow some indulgence
in fouy.”—A pleasant way of reasoning indeed, as if power and wealth
gave a man a privilege to be weak and wicked without control. As
ridiculous, however, as this reasoning appears, the poet tells us, and
tells us correctly, that it is in one sense trae enough. The follies and
vices of the rich and poor are equal in themselves, yet they are very
unequal in their consequences. The former are better able to support
them without ruining themselves and families ; whereas, when a man
of but moderate fortune indulges in such a line of conduct, ruin both
to him and his is sure to ensue.-30. Arata decet sanum comitem toya.

merely apply to dress, but extends, in fact, to buildings, table, equipage,

which the rich man has just bestowed upon his wealth‚ as forming a pkind
of shield for his follies, the poet, to show hiscontempt of riches‚ im-
mediately subjoins the story of Eutrapelus, who was accustomed to
bestow, on those he wished to injure, costly and magnificent gar-meum,
