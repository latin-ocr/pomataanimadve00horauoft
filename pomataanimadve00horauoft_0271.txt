Quid nos, quibus te vita si superstite 5
Jucunda, si contra, gravis?
Utrumne jussi persequemur otium,

Magis relictis 3 non, ut adsit, auxili
Latura plus praesentibus.
Libenter hoc et omne militabitur
Bellum in tuae spem gratiae3

any greater aid on that account to her offspring placed before her eyes.''
A poetical pleonasm occurs in the term praesentibus, and, in a free
translation, the word may be regarded as equivalent simply to iis. The
idea intended to be conveyed by the whole sentence is extremely beautiful.
The poet likens himself to the parent bird, and, as the latter sits by her
