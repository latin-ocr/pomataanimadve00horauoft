56¹* Q. HORATII FLACCI

Quam spectatoris fastidia ferre superbi, 21⁵
Curam redde brevem, si munus Apolline dignum
Vis complere libris, et vatibus addere calcar,
Ut studio majore petant Helicona virentem.

Multa quidem nobis facimus mala saepe poetae,
(Ut vineta egomet caedam mea) quum tibi librum 220
Sollicito damus aut fesso; quum laedimur, unum
Si quis amicorum est ausus reprendere versum ;
Quum loca jam recitata revolvimus irrevocati;
Quum lamentamur, non apparere labores
Nostros, et tenui deducta po'e'mata filo 3
Quum speramus eo rem venturam, ut simul atque
Carmina rescieris nos fingere, commodus ultro
ArcessaS, et egere vetes, et- scribere cogas.

Sed tamen est operae pretium cognoscere, quales

known to the public, distinction and advancement are sure to follow.''
215-—2-27. 215. Spectatorz's fastidia superbi. “ The capricious hu-
mor οἵ an arrogant spectator.”—·2]6. Curam redde brevem. “ Bestow
in turn some little attention.”—Munus Apolline di9n21n1‚- alluding to
the Palatine library, established by the emperor. Consult note on
Epist. 1. iii. 17.—219. lllulta quidem nobis facim us, (xc. Compare
note on verse sla—220. Ut vineta eyomet caedam mea. “ That I may
prune my own vineyard ;” z'. e. that I may be severe against myself as
well as against others—221. Quum laedimur, unum si quis amicorum,
ἃς. Horace now touches upon the vanity of the poetical tribe.
Compare note on verse 214.—·2·23. Quum loca jam recitata revolvimus
{rr-evocati. ‘⁶ When‚unasked‚ we repeat passages already read.” The
allusion is to the Roman custom of authors reading their productioris
to a circle of friends or critice in order to ascertain their opinion
respecting the meiits of the work submitted to their notice.—Irrevocati ‚-
equivalent here to injussi. The allusion is borrowed from the Roman
stage where an actor was said revocari, whose performance gave such
approbation that he was reoassed hythe audience for the purpose of
repeating it, or, as we would say, was enom-ed.—·224. Non apparere.
¹ “ Do not appear ;‘“ τ’. e. was not noticed.—-·2·25. Et tenui deducta poemata
filo. “ And our poems spun out in a fine thread ;” i. e. and our finelsm
wrought verses—227. Commodus ultro arcessas. “ Thou wilt kind1y‚ of
thine own accord, send for uss
229—233. 229. Sed tamen est operae pretium, διο. Horace now
touches upon a new theme. Fond and presumptuouS, observes he, as
are the hopes of poets, it may well deserve a serious consideration, who
of them are fit to be entrusted with the glory of princes 3 what minis-
ters are worth retaining in the service of an illustrious virtue, whose
honours demand to be solemnized with a religious reverence, and should

support this position, he alleges the example of a great monarch, who
