EPISTULARUM LIB. 1. l. 457

Si possiS, recte; si non, quocunque modo rem,
Ut propius spectes lacrimosa poe'mata Pupi:
An qui, fortunae te responsare superbae
Liberum et erectum, praesens hortatur et aptat?
Quod si me populus Romanus forte roget, cur 70
Non, ut porticibus, sic judiciis fruar isdem,
Nec sequar aut fugiam, quae diligit ipse vel odit3
Olim quod vulpes aegroto cauta leoni
Respondit, referam : Quia me vestigjicc terrent

Omnia te culversmn spectantia, mella retrorsum. 75
Bellua multorum est capitum. Nam quid sequar? aut
quem ἲ

Pars hominum gestit conducere publica ; sunt qui
Crustis et pomis viduas venentur avaras,
Excipiamque senes, quos in vivaria mittant ;

derstand suadet.— 67. Ut propius spectes lacrimosa poemata Pupi.
“That thou mayst view from a nearer bench the moving tragedies of
Pupius ;” i. e. mayest witness the representation as an Eques, seated
on one of the fourteen rows assigned to that order by the law of Otho:
in other words, that thou mayst attain to Equestrian rank. Compare

Responsare. “ “ To resist.'' Compare Serm. 11. vii. 85.—69. Praesens.
‘⁶ Standing by ;'’ i. e. adding weight to his precepts by his presence.
70—79. 70. Cur non, ut porticibus, δίο. “ Why Ι (10 not hold to
the same sentiments with them, as I enjoy the same pmticoes, and do
not pursue or shun whatever they themselves admire 01· dislike.'’ Con-
sult note on Sat. 1. iv. 134.—74. Quia me vestigia terrent, ἃς. The
fox dreaded the treachery of the lion, the poet shrinks from the cor-
rupt sentiments and morals of the populace-76. Bellaa multorum est
capitum. ‘⁴ It is a many-headed monster.” The pcople, ever prone to
error, and constantly changing from one species of vice to another, are
here not unaptly compared to the Lei-nean hydra. (θηρίον πολυκέφα-
λον.)--77. Condzccere publica. “ ln farming the public revenues.”
Understand vectiyalia. Hence the farmers of the rovenue, who were
principally of Equestrian rank, were styled Public-ani. The office was
much more honourable at Rome than in the provinces, where the infe-
rior agents practised every kind of extortion.--79. Eoedpiantqzae serm,
quo-3 in vivaria mittant. “ And catch old men, whom they may send to
their ponds.” Old men are here compared to fish, as in Sat. 11. v. 44.
“ Plures armabunt thuani, et cetaria ‹:rescent.'’ Eoecz'pere is the proper
term to be used here. Compare the Greek ἐκδέχεσθαι. Both are here
used to denote the securing of any prey or game.— Vivaria. A general
term to express places where liviny animals are kept sor future use.
