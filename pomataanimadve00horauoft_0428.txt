Dum doceo insanire omnes vos, ordine adite.

Danda est ellebori multo pars maxima avaris ε
Nescio an Anticyram ratio illis destinet omnem.

hellebore. The second lay on a bend of the Sinus Corinthiacus, aasz

graved the sum he lest them on his tomb‚” With summam the genitive
hereditatis may be supplied—85. Gladiatorum dare centum, διο. “ They
were bound by the wffl to exbibit a hundred pair of gladiators to the
people.'' The term damnati contains an allusion to the form of the will,
in which the testator required any thing of his 110115, Heres meus damnas
esto, or Heredes mei damnas sunta—86. Arri. Arrius appears to have
been a noted yourmand of the day3 and an entertajnment such as he
should direct, would be, of course, no unexpensive one.—87. Frumenti
quantum metit Africa. Africa. Propria was famed for its fertility.-ffive
eyo prave seu recte hoc volui, ne sis patruus mihi. The words employed
