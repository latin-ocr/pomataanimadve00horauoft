CARMINUM L1B. lv. 9. 215

N on, si priores Maeonius tenet 5
Sedes Homerus, Pindaricae latent,
Ceaeque, et Alcaei minaces,
Stesichorique graves Camenae z

Nec, si quid olim lusit Anacreon,
Delevit aetas : spirat adhuc amor, 10
Vivuntque commissi calores

Aeoliae fidibus puellae.

Non sola comtos arsit adulteri
Crines, et aurum vestibus illitum
Mirata, regalesque cultus 16
Et comites Helene Lacaena:

Primusve Teucer tela Cydonio
Direxit arcu: non semol Ilios
Vexata: non pugnavit ingens
Idomeneus Sthenelusve solus 20

still the sum'ns of Pindar and tho Ccan Simonides, and the threatening
lines of Alcaeus, and tho dignified effusions of Stesichorus, are not hid
from the knowledge of posterity.” More lite-rally: “ The Pindaric and
Cean Muses, and the threatening ones of Alcaeus, and the dignified ones
of Stesichorus.'‘ As regards the epithetll'Iaeonius, applied to Homer,

Sicily, and born about 632 B.C. He was contemporary with Sappho,
Alcaeus, and Pittacus. He used the Dorio (halect, and, besides hymno
in honour of the gods, and odes in praise of heroes, cornposed what may
be called lyro-cpic poems, such as one entitlcd “ The Destruction of
Troy‚” and another called ‘⁶ The Orestia‹l.'’—9. Nec, si qaid olim, &c-
“ Nor, if Anacreon, in former days, produced any sportive effusion‚ has
time destroyed this.'' Time, however, hasmade scarful ravages, for us,
in the productions of this bard. At the present day, we can attribute to
Anacreon only the fragments that were collected by Ursinus, and a few
additional ones 3 and not those poenis which commonly go under his name,
a few only excepted.

11—49. ll. Calores Aeoliae puellae. ‘⁶ The impassioned feelings of
the Aeolian maid.'’ The allusion is to Sappho. consult note on Ode

follows: Lacaena Helene non sola arsit comtos crines adulteri, et
mirata (est) aunam—14. Auram vestibus illitum. “ The gold spread
profusely over his garmerus ;’' i. e. his garments richly embroidered with
gold.—15. Reyalesque cultus et comites. “ And his regal splendour and
