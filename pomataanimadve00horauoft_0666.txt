fabula. .“ A play striking in its moral topics‚ and marked by a just ex-
pression of the manners-’'—3‘23. Graiis ingenium, Graiis dedit, διο. The
Greeks being eminent for philosophy, the last observation naturally gave
rise to this. For the transition is easy from their superiority as philoso-
phers to their superiority as poets 3 and the more easy, as the latter is
shown to be in part the effect of the former. Now this superiority of
the Greeks in genius and eloquence (which would immediately occur on
mentioning the Socraticae chartae) being seen and confessed. we are led
to ask, whence this arises? The answer is, from their making glory‚
not gain, the object of their wishes.— Ore rotundo. The poet does not
merely refer to rotundity of expression, as if he were only praising the
language of the Greeks, but to a full, and rich, and finished diction,
flowing at once from aliberal and cultivated mind—324. Nullius. ‘⁶ Of
nothing else.” Supply alius rei. 1
325-329. 3⁰25. Longis rationibus. “By long computation.” 326.

Dicas, filius Albini. ‘⁶ Pray, tell me, thou that art the son of Albinus.”
In illustration of what he has just asserted respecting the early studies of
the Roman youth, the poet here gives us a short but amusing dialogue
between an instructor and his pupil‚ in which the former examines the
latter upon his proficiency in the art of calculaffion, and seeks to show
h³m off to the bystanders. Albinus was a well-known usurer of the day
and the expressionfilius Albini (i. e. tu qui es filius Albini) implies tha.
the son must keep up the reputation of the family in money matters,
and the mysteries of reckoning.—3·27. Si de quincunce remota est uncia,
quid superet? “ If an uncia be taken from a quincunx, what remains ‘3³'
The Roman As was divided into twelve unciae, of which the third was
termed Triens, and consisted of four wiciae3 the half was Semis, or six
mzciae,· and the Quinctium was five unciae-328. Poteras dixisse. Triens.
“ Thou surely canst tell : a third of a pound.'’ According to the lec-
tion we have adopted in our text, these words are supposed, like those‘
which have just gone before, to proceed from the instructor. He pauses
fo? a moment after his first question, (si de quincunce, διο.) in expecta-
tion of an answer from his pupil. But the poor boy, bewildered, no
doubt, by the longae rationes to which he has been closely confined,
remains silent. Full of cagerness, the sage instructor, in a haH-cfflding,
half-encouraging tone, exclaims, poteras dixisse (“ why not answer‘!
surely thou knowest it’'), and prompts him to the true reply (Τήθης).-
Eu! rem poteris servare tuam. “Well done, my boy ; thou wilt be
able to take care of thy own.'' The cry of the pedagogue, after the
