These were female players of the most debauched and dissolute kind.—
Balatrones. The various explanations given of this term, render it
difficult to determine what the true meaning is. Our translation accords
with the remark of Diiring, who makes the word denote the whole class
of low and dirty parasites.—3. Tiyelli'. Th efercncc is to M. Hermo-
genes Tigellius, a well-known singer and &aaa of the day, who had
stood high in favour with Julius Caesar, and after him with Augustus.
He seems to have been indebted sor his clevation to a fine voice, and a
eourtly and insinuating address. His moral character may bc inferrcd
from those who are said here to deplore his death, and on whom 118 would
appear to have squandered much of his wenna—4. Quippe benignus
erat. ⁴⁴ For 118 was a kind patron.'’—Contra hic. The reference is now
to some other individual of direetly opposite character.-—-7. Hunc si
perconteris, &c. “ If thou ask a third, why, lost to every better feeling,
he squanders the noble inlieritance of his ancestors in ungrateful gluttony.'’
—8. Sto-inqut. The allusion is properly a figurative one to the stripping
off the leaves from a branch.—9. Omnia conductis coemens, &a
“Buying up with borrowcd money every rare and dainty viand.'' The
lender is said locare pecuniam, the borrower, conducere pecuniam.-
10. Animi parvi. ‘⁶ Of a mean spirit.’'—ll. Laudatur ub his, &c.
“For this line of conduct, 118 is commended by some, he is censui-ed by
others.''

12—20. 12. Fufidius. A noted usurer.-Vappaefa=mam limet ac
nebulonis. Consult note on Serm. 1. i. 104.—13. Positis in fenore,
“Laid out at interest.'' Pecuniam in fenore ponere is used for pecu—
niam fenori dara—14. Quinas hic capiti, ἔζε- “ He deducts from the
principa} five common inter-ests.'’ Among the Romans, as among the
Greeks, money was lent from mouth to mouth, and the interest for the
mouth preceding was paid on the Calends of the next. The usual rate
was one as monthly for the use of a hundred, or twelve per cent. per
anuum, which was called usura centesima, because in a hundred months
the interest equalled the principal. Iu the present case, however, Fufidius
charges five per cent. monthly, or sixty per cent. per annum; and, not
content even with this exorbitant usury‚ actually deducte the interest
before the money is lent. For instance, he lends a hundred pounds, and,
at the end of the mouth, the borrower is to pay him a hundred and five,
principa! and interest. But he gives only ninety-five pounds‚ deducting
