Ire, viam qua monstret eques. Venaticus, ex quo 65
Tempore cervinam pellem latravit in aula,

Militat in silvis catulus. Nunc adbibe puro

Pectore verba, puer, nunc te melioribus offer.

Quo semel est imbuta recens, servabit odorem

Testa diu. Quod si cessas aut strenuus anteis, 70
N cc tardum opperior nec praecedentibus insto.

mind, at that period of life, easily receives impressions, and what is then
learned is seldom forgotten.-—66. Cervinam pellem. latravit in aula ‚-
alluding to the custom of training up young hounds by placing before
them the skin of a stag, stuffed with straw or other materials, so as to
resemble the living {mirmah—In aula. ‘⁴ In the court-yard.'' Aula is
here a court-yard, or area generally, enclosed on all sides, and in which
young dogs were trained to the hunt—67. Nunc adhibe puro pectore
verba, &c. ‘⁶ Now, in the days of thy youth, drink deep into thy pure
breast the language of instruction ; now give thyself up to those who are
wiser.” Verba may also be here rendered, “these my words,'’ but with
less propriety and force—69. Quo semel est imbuta recens, &c. ‘⁶ A jar
will long retain the odour of the liquor with which, when new, it was
once impregnated.’'—70. Quod ει cessas. ἃς. The idea intended to he
here conveyed is thus expressed by Francis, from Torrentius and Dacier:
If ¹thou wilt run the race of wisdom with me, let us run together ; for, if
thou stoppest, 01· endeavour-est to get before me, I shall neither wait for
thee, nor strive to overtake thee. When we enter the lists of virtue, to

{yenit for those behind us is indolence, too earnestly to pursue those be-
ore us is envy.

Emsnss III.—In the year of the city 731, Tiberius was sent at the
head of an army into Dalmatia. Julius Florus, to whom this epistle is
addressed, was in his train. He continued visiting and regissating the
provinces until the year 734, when he received orders from Augustus
to march to Armenia, and replace Tigranes on the throne. It is at this
time that Horace writes to Florus. Gur poet here marks the route of

Tiberius through Thrace, and across the HellesponE into Asia Minor, · >

thus making his epistle a kind of public historical monument. Florus
had reproached the bard for never writing to him, and the latter, in a
pleasant kind of revenge, reckons a large number of particulare of public
and private news which he expected in answer to his letter. It would
seem, however, that Horace had also another object in view, and this
was to make his friend sensible, how prejudicial to him his ambition and

his love of riches were, which he does in the softest and most friendly
manner.
