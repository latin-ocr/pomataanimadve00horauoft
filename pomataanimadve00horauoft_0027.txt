METRES* OF HORACE.

—0—

1. DAcerc Hssmmrm.
Laszcilbfint &lili chilo-Em ΗΙιῦιίὔη 1 αῡί ΛΙῑίῇΙῖέηέη.

Tnz structure of this species of verse is sufficicntly well known ; it
consists of six feet, the fifth of which is a dactyL and the sixth a spondee‚
while each of the other four feet may be either a dactyl or spondee.
Sometimes, however, in a solemn, majestic, or mournful description, or in
expressing astonishment, consternation, vastness of sizo, &c.‚ a spondae is
admitted in tlic fifth foot, and the line is then denominated Spondaic.

The hexameters of Horace, in his Satires and Epissses, are written in so
negligent a manner as to lead to the opinion, that this style of composition
was purposely adopted by him to suit the nature of his subject. whether
this opinion be correct or not, must be considered elsewhere. It will only
be requisite here to state, that the peculiar character ol⁴ his hexameter

versification will render it unnecessary for us to say anything respecting the ,

doctrine of the eaesuml pause in this species οῖ’ verse, which is better
explained with reference to the rhythm and cadence of virgil.

2. DAc'rvuc TETRAMETER a posteriore *.

The—Tetrameter α posteriore, or Spondaic tetrameter, consists of the
last four feet of an hexameter: as

Certfzs ἔΙηΞηι prolmisit 141p5ll5.

Sometimes, as in the hexameter, a spondee occupies the laet place but

one, in which case the preceding foot ought to be a dactyL or the line will
be too heavy ; as,

IlIZnsfier’m οόΙιῖῑὺέηί ἈνΙεῘιᾶίᾶ.

3. Dacrmc 'ramma-t Cer-Amene-

The Trimeter catalectic is a line consisting οῖ’ the first five half-sect of
an hexameter, or two feet and a half 3 as,

’Arbb‘rilbffisquZ οὕΙηιηέ.

* The expression α posteriore. refers to the verse being considered as
taken from the latter passrtpf an hexameter line, (a posteriore parte
versus hexametri) and is consequently opposed to the dact31ic tetrameter
a priore. This last is taken from {lie first part (a priore parte) of au
hexameter, and must always have the last* fobt a'd'actyl.
