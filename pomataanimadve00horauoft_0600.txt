556 Q. HORATH FLACCI

Poscit opem chorus, et praesentia numina sentit3
Coelestes implorat aquas, docta prece blandus 135

Avertit morbos, metuenda pericula pellit,-
Impetrat et pacem, et locupletem frugibus annum.
Carmine Di superi placantur, carmine Manes.

Agricolae prisci, fortes, parvoque beati,
Condita post frumenta, levantes tempore festo 140
Corpus, et ipsum animum spe finis dura ferentem,
Cum sociis operum, pueris, et conjuge fida,
Tellurem porco, Silvanum lacte piabant,
Floribus et vino Genium, memorem brevis aevi.

Hurd. “ But religion, which was its noblest end, was, besides, the first
object of poetry. The dramatic muse in particular had her birth, and
derived her very character from it. This circumstance then leads him,
with advantage, to give an historical deduction of the rise and progress
of Latin poetry, from its first rude workings in the days of barbarous
superstition, through every successive period of its improvement,
down to his own times.’'-l41. Spe finis. “ Through the hope of their
ending.”-—l43. Tellurem porco, Silvanum lacte piabant. The poet here
selects two from the large number of rural divinities, Tellus, or Ceres,
and Silvanus—144. Genium, memorem brevis aevi. “ The Genius that,
