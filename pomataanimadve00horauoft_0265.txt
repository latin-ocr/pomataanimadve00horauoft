CARMINUM Lm. 1v. 14. 225

Dejecit acer plus vice simplici.
Major Neronum mox grave proelium
Commisit, immanesque Raetos 15
Auspiciis pepulit secundis:

Spectandus in certamine Martio,
Devota morti pectora liberae
Quantis fatigaret ruinis:
Indomitas prope qualis undas 20

Exercet Auster, Pleiadum choro
scindente nubes : impiger hostium
Vexare turmas, et frementem
Mittere equum modios per ignes.

Neronum. ‘⁴ The elder of the Ner0s;” alluding to Tiberius, the future
emperor.—l5. Immanesque Raetos auspiciis, διο. “And under thy
favour-ing auspices drove back the ferociens Raeti.'’ In the time of the
republic, when the consul performed anything in person, lie was said to
do it by his own conduct and auspices (ductu, vel imperio, et auspicio
suo); but if his lienteriam, or any other person, did it by his command,
it was said to be done auspicio consu-lis, ductu leyafi, under the auspices
of the consul, and the conduct of the legatus. In this manner the
emperors were said to do everything, by their own auspices, although
they remained at Rome—By the Raeti in the text are meant the united
forces of the Raeti, Vindelici, aud their allies. The first of these con-
stituted‚ iu fact, the smallest part, as their strength had already been broken
by Drusus. Compare Introductory Remarks to the fourth Ode of this
Book. ·
17—33. 17. spectandus in certamine Marcio, διο. “ Giving an
illustrious proof in the martial conflict, with what destruction he could
overwhelm those bosoms that were devoted to death in the cause of free·
dom.'' The poet here alludes to the custom prevalent among these, and
other barbarous natious, especially such as were of Germanic or Celtic
origin, of devotiug themselves to death in desence of their country's freo-
dom—21. Eoeercet. “ Tames.'’—Ple·2'adum choro scindente nube-⁹, διν.
“ When the dance of the Pleiades is severing the clouds.'' A beautiful
mode of expressing the rising of these stars. ” The Pleiades arc seven stars
in the neck of the Bull. They are fablcd to have been seven of the (laugh-
ters of Atlas, whence they are also called Atlantides. (Virg. Georg. i.
221.) They rise with the sun on the tenth day before the Calcnds of
May (22d April), according to Columella. The Latin writers generally
call them Verqiliae, from their rising about the Vernal Equinox. The
appellation of Pleiades is supposed to come from πλέω, “to sail,’'
because their rising marked the season when the storms of winter had
departed, and everything favoured the renewal of navigation. Some,
however, derive the name from πλείονες, because they appear in a
cluster; and thus we find Manilius calling them ‘⁴ sidus ylomerabile.''——
24. Medios per iynes. Some Commentators regard this as a proverbial
expression, alluding to an affair full of imminent danger, and compare it
