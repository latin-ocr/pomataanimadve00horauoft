Q. HORATII FLACGI
CARMINUM

LIBER QUARTUS.

CARMEN 1.
AD VENEREM.

INTERMISSA, Venus, diu

Rursus bella moves, Parce, precor, precor!
Non sum, qualis eram bonae

Sub regno Cinarae. Desine, dulcium
Mater saeva Cupidinum, 5

Circa lustra decem flectere mollibus
Jam durum imperiis. Abi,

Quo blandae juvenum te revocant preces.
Tempestivius in domum

Pauli, purpureis ales oloribus, 10
