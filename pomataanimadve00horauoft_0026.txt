xxii LIFE ΑΜ) anRAc'rER OF MAECENAS.

and the pure air of Tibur, with the streams tumbling into the valley
through the arches of the villa, did bestow on the worn-out and
sleepless courtier some few 111011ιο1115 of repose. But all these
resources at length failed. The nervous aud severish disorder with
which Maecenas was afflicted increased 50 dreadfully, that, for three
years before his death he never closed his eyes. In his last will he
recommended Horace, in the most affectionate terms, to the protec-
tion of the emperor: ‘⁶ Horatii Flacci, ut mei, memor esto.” He
died in 745, in the same year with Horace, and was buried in his
own ardens 011 1110 Esquiline hill. He left no child; and in Mae-
cenas terminated the line of the ancient Etrurian princes : but he
boqueathed to posterity a name, immortal as the arts of which he
had been through life the genereus protector, and which 15 deeply

fatal to civiiisation.

Maecenas had nominated Augustus as his heir, aud the emEeror
thus became possessed of the ἘΙ-10111110 villa, which had formed the
principal residence of the minister during the close of his life, and in
which the monarch passed a trr= eat nart 91² the concluding years of
his reign*. The death of his old favourite revived 311 1110 esteem
which Augustus had once entertained for him3 and many years
afterwards, when stung with regret at having divulged the shame of
his daughter Julia„ and punished her offence, he ackuowledged his
irreparable loss, by exclaimiug, that 110 would have been prevented
from acting such a part had Maecenas been still alive. So difficult
was it to repair the loss of one man, though 110 had millions of
subjecte under his obedience. “ His legions,” says Seneca, “ being
cut to pieces, he recruited his troops—his fleets, destroyed by storms,
were soon refitted--public edifices, consumed by the flames, were

 

 

 

rebuilt with greater magnificence 3 but he could find no one capable
of discharging the offices which had been held by Maecenas, with

equal integrity and ability.⁷'

* “ Maeeenas’s villa,'' says Eustace, “ stands 31 the extremity of the
town, 011 the brow of the hill, and hangs over several streamlets, which fall
down the steep.1t commands a noble view of the Anio, and its vale

be,neath the hills of Albano and 111001100111 1110 Campagna‚ and Rome
itself, rising on 1Ηο Borders of the horizon. * ’¹‘ * A branch of the river
pours through the arched gallery and vapltffiffljflllzr& and, shaking tho
edifice as it 1135505 along, rushes 111 several sheets down the declivity’'
