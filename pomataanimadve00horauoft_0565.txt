Attingit solium J ovis et coelestia tentat.

Principibus placuisse viris nos ultima laus est. 35
N on cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum.
Sedit, qui timuit ne non succederet: esto:
Quid? qui pervenit, fecitne viriliter? Atqui
Hic est aut nusquam, quod quaerimus : hic onus horret,
Ut parvis animis et parvo corpore majus ; 40
Hic subit et perfert. Aut virtus nomen inane est,
Aut decus et pretium recte petit experiens vir.
Coram rege suo de paupertate tacentes
Plus poscente ferent. Distat, sumasne pudenter,
An rapias: atqui rerum caput hoc erat, hic fons. 45

merce with the world, and are actuated by no ambition. His reason-
ing is this: Princes who gain great victories, and triumph over their
enemies‚ almost equal the godS‚ and acquire inimortal renown: in like
manner, they whose merit recommends them to the favour of these true
images of the deity, are by this raised above the rest of their species.
The poet here both makes his court to Augustus, and defends the part
he had himself chosen; for, in the first satire of the second book, he
tells us, that envy itself must own he had lived in reputation with the
great.—-35. Principibus viris. “The great.'’ Principibus is here used
in a more extensive signification than ordinary, and indicates the great,
the powerful, the noble, &ze—36. Non cuivis homini contingit adire
Corinthum. A proverbial form of expression, and said of things that are
arduous and perilous, and which it is not the fortune of every one to
sui-mount. Horace, by using this adage, intends to show that all people
have not talents proper for succeeding in a court, while he seeks at the
same time to raise the glory of those who have courage to attempt, and
address to conquer the difficulties there.

37—40. 37. Sedit, qui timuit, διο. The idea intended to be con-
veyed is this: The man that doubts of success, sits still, and so far is
well. Be it so. What then P He who has carried this point, has he
not acted with the spirit of a man Ρ Now, the things that we seek after
are to be obtained by the exercise of moral courage and resolution, or
not at all. This man dreads the burden, as too great either for his
strength or courage: another attempts it, and happily succeeds, διο.
In this way Horace seeks to impress upon Scaeva the importance of
zealous and untiring effort in conciliating the favour of the grean—4⁶2.
Aut decus et pretium recle petit experiens τὶν. “Or he Who makes the
attempt deservedly claims the honour and thc reward.'’ If there be
difficulty or danger, he certainly deseri es the highest praise who tries to
succeed; and if virtue be any thing more than a mere idle name, he may
with justice claim a reward proponional to his merit. -43. Coram rege
suo, διο. “ They who say nothing about narrow means in the presence
of their patron, will receive more than the importunate.”—44. Distat,
sumasne pudenter, an rapias. “ There is a difference, whether one
take with modesty what is offered, or eagerly snatch at roffi—45. Atqui
rerum caput hoc erat, hic jons. ‘⁴ For this is the capital point, this is
