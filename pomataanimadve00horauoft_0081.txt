Fertur Prometheus, addere principi
Limo coactus particulam undique
Desectam, et insani leonis 15
Vim stomacho apposuisse nostro.

Irae Thyesten exitio gravi
Stravere, et altis urbibus ultimae
Stetere causae, our perirent

Hostile aratrum exereitus insolens.
Compesce mentem : me quoque pectoris

sion Noricus ensis is used to denoto the goodness ofa swerd. Noricum,
after its reduction under the Roman sway, corresponded nearly to the
modern duchies of Carinthia and styria—11. Saevus iynis. “ The
’⁷ uuspming lightning :'' thc fire of the skies.—Nec tremendo, &c- “Nor
¹'Jove himself, rushing down amid dreadful thunderings.” Compare the
Greek expression Zela—s καταιβάτης, applied to Jove hurling his thunder-
bolts.

13—16. 13. Fertur Prometheus, &c. According to the fable, Pro⁴
meffieus, having exhausted his stock of materials in the formation of other
animals, was compelled to take a part from each of them, (particulam
undique desectam,) and added to it the clay which formed the p1imitive
clement of man (principi limo). Hence the origin of anger, Prometheus
having “placed in our breast the wild rage of the lion‚” (insani leonis
vim, i. e. insanam leonis vium—16. Stomacho. The term stomachus
properly denotes the canal through which· aliment descends into the
stomach3 it is then taken to express the upper orifiee of the stomach3
(compare the Greek καρδία ;) and, finally, the ventricle in which the food
is digested. Its reference to anger or choler arises from the circumstance
of a great number of nerves being situated about the upper orifice of the
stomach, which reude'f‘it‘ very sensible3 and from these also proceeds the
great sympathy between the Stflfflessh, head, and heart. It was on this
account Van Helmont thought that the sou] had its seat in the upper orifice
of the stomach.

17—18. 17. I rae. “ Angxy contentions.''—-Thyesten ‚⁰ alluding to
the horrid state of Atreus and Q.—18. Et altis urbibus, &c-
“ And have been the primary cause to lofty cities, why,” &c. A Graecism
for et ultimae stetere causae cur altae urbes funditus perirent, διο.
“ And have been the piimary cause why lofty cities have been completely
overthrown,'' διο. The expression altis urbibus isin accordance with the
Greek, αἰπὺ πτολίεθρον, πόλις αἰπεῖα. The elegant use ofgfflgzgsor
exstitere or suere must be noted ; it carries with it the accompanying idea

of something Q and certain, Compare virgil ι (Aen. vii. 735.)
“Stant belli causae.'’

20-27. 20. Imprimeretque muris, &c. Alluding to the custom‚
prevalent among the ancients, of drawin a lou h over the ground pre-
viously occupied by the vwalls and buildings oi affl and Qed αἰξὶ..-
