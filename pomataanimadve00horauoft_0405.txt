nonnius.
Quid faciam? Saltat Milonius, ut semel icto
Accessit fervor capiti numerusque lucernis ¹25

Castor gaudet equis3 ovo prognatus eodem

Pugnis; quot capitum vivunt, totidem studiorum

Millia: me pedibus delectat claudere verba,

Lucili ritu, nostrum melioris utroque.

Ilie velut fidis arcana sodalibus olim 30
credebat libris; neque, si male cesserat, unquam
Decurrens alio, neque, si bene: quo fit, ut omnis

Votiva pateat veluti descripta tabella.

Vita senis. Sequor hunc, Lucanus an AppuJuS, anceps:
Nam Venusinus arat finem sub utrumque, colonus 35
Missus ad hoc, pulsis, vetus est ut fama, Sabellis,

Serm. 1. viii. 11.—‘23. Intactas, “Though as yet unassailed.”—Et
odit. “ And hates both verses of this kind and those who compose them.''
——24. Quid faciam? &e The poet here strives to excuse himself, and
alleges the following plea in his defence z—Human pursuits are as various
as naen themselves are many. One individual is fond of dancing the
moment his head is turned with wine, another is fond of horses, a third
of pugiljstic encounters; my delight, like that of Lucilius, consists in
writing satirical effusions.—Saltat Blilom'us. The Romans held dancing
in general in little estimation.—-Ut semel icto, ἃς. “ The moment his
head, affected with the fumes of wine, grows 1= -t‚ and the lights appear
doubled to his view.'‘—-‘26. Castor qaudet equis. Compare Ode 1. xii. 26.
—Ovo prognatus eodem. Pollux. Compare Ode 1. xii. 26.—28. Pedibus
claudere verba. “To versify.”—‘29. Nostrum melioris utroque. The
argument α fortiori. If Lucilius, “ who was superior, in point of birth
and fortune, to us both‚'’ (nostrum melioris utroque, ) was not ashamed

, to write satires, with much stronger reason should Ι, a man of ignobie

birth, banish all fear of degrading myself by indulging in this same
species of composition. ‚

31—37. 31. Neque, si male cesserat, διε. “Neither having recourse
elsewhere, if his affairs went ill, nor if well.''—3·2. Quo fit, ut omnis,
διο. “Whence it happens, that the whole lifc of the old bard is as open
to the view, as if it were represented in a votive painting.'' The ex-
pression votiva tabella alludes to the Roman custom of hanging up, in
some temple or public place, in accordance with a vow, a painting, in
which was represented some signal deliverance‚ or piece of good fortune,
that had happened to the individual. It was most frequently done
in enses of escape from shipwreck.—34. Sequor hunc, Lucanus an
Appulus, anceps, διε, Α pleasing and slily-satirioel imitation of the wan-
dering and talkative manner of Lucilius in descn'bing the circumstances
and events of his own life. One geographical mile south of Venusia,
there was a chain diverging from the Apennines‚ which separated Apulia
from Lucania. Hence the city of Venusia, the natal place of Horace,
