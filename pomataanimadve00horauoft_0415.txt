indulges in a bitter sarcasm. This individual never was praetor ; he had
merely stood candidate for the office, and had been rejected by the peo-
ple on account of the badness of his private character.

51-—6-2. 51. Edioeerit. Another hit at Sempronius. Edicere pro—
perly means to issue an edict as praetor.-53. Sordidus a tenui victu,
Sec. Ofellus thus far has been inveighing‚ through the poet, against the
luxurious and the gluttonous, and recommending a plain and simple
course of life. He now interposes a cantion, and warns us that this
plain mode of life which he advocates, must by no means be confounded
with a mean and sordid one.——54. Nam frustra vitium vitaveris illud,
ὅτε. “ For to no purpose wilt thou have shunned that vice which has
just been condemned, if thou perversely· turn away to its oppositos·—
Avidienus. A fictitious name most probably. We know nothing far·
ther of this personage than what Horace states. His filth and his im-
pudence obtained for him the nick-name of ‘⁶ Dog.'' He ate olives that
were five years old, whereas they were usually accounted good for no-
thing aster two years—56. Ductum. “ Derived.”—57. Est. “ Eats.”
From edo.—58. Ao nisi mutatum, διε. “ And avoids pouring out his
wine until it has become sour.'' Parcit defundere is elegantly used for
non defundit, or nonvult defundere.—-Et cujus odorem olei nequeas per-
ferre, &c. The order of construction is as follows 3 Et (licebit ille alba—
tus celebret repotia, natales, aliosve festos dierum) ipse instillat, bilibri
cornu, caulibus, oleum, odorem cujus olei⁴71equeas perferre, ‘non parcus
veteris aceti.—59. Isicebit. “ Although.'' In the sense of licet or
quamvis.—60. Repotia. The repotia was an entertainment given by
the husband on the day after the marriage, when presente were sent to
the bride by her friends and relations, and she began to act as mistress
of the family by performing sacred rites.--Dierum festos. A Graecism
for dies festos—61. Albatus. “ Clothed in white.'' The general colour
of the Roman toga was white; this colom, however, was peculiarly
adopted bv the guests, or those who bore a part at formal banquets,
or on occasions of ceremony.—Ipse. “ With his own hands.” In this
showing his mean and sordid habits, since, afraid that his guests, or his
slaves, should be too profuse of his oil, bad as it was, he pours it out
himself. Nor is this all: he pours it out drop by drop (instillat).
Moreover, the vessel containing it was of two pounds weight, as if it
