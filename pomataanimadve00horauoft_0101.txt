city of Thrace, subsequently included within the limits of Macedonia.
Orpheus was said to have been born here.—9. Nil sine te mei, δῖε.
”’“ῚἫῐῇουι thy favouring aid, the honours which 1 have received can
prove of no avail in celebrating the praises of others.” By the term
honores the poet alludes to his successful cultivation of lyric versa—10.
Fidibus novis. “ In new strains,” i. e. in lyric verse. Hence the bard
speaks of himself as the first that had adapted the Aeolian strains to
Italian mensures. (Ode 111. xxx. 13.)-11. Lesbio plectro. “ On the
Lesbian lyre.’' The lectrum, or quill, is here taken figuratively for t‘ne
l5re itself. Compare Ode 1. ι. 33 .—-Sacrare. “ To consecrate to im-

cantharus, it was sacred to Bacchus.—2. Thracum est. Compare note
on vde 1. xviii. 9.--3. Vm; equivalent to modicum, “ Foe to
excess.’'—5. Vino et lucernis, ἃς. “ It is wonderful how much the
daggor of the Parthian is at variance with nocturnal banquets,'’ literally
“ with wine and lights.'’ Vino and lucernis are datives, put by a Grae-
cism for the ablative with the preposition a.—Medus. Compare Ode
1. ii. 5l.-A0inaces. The term is of Persian ori 'n. The acinaces was
properly a small dagger in use among ffie Persians, and borrowed from
them by the soldiers of later ages. It was worn at the side. Hesychius,
