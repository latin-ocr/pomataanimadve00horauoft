ners-romam! Lm. 1. 13. 505

Victor propositi simul ac perveneris illue,

Sic positum servabis onus, ne forte sub ala

Fasciculum portes librorum, ut rusticus agnum ;

Ut vinosa glomus furtivae Pyrrhia lanae ;

Ut cum pileolo soleas conviva tribulis. 15
Neu vulgo narres te sudaxdsse ferendo

Carmina, quae possint oculos auresque morari

Caesaris ; oratus multa prece, nitere porro,

Vade, vale, cave, ne titubes mandataque frangas.

bour, and tells him that he should bewarc of blundering in the presence
of the courtiers‚ who would most easily rally him, in such an event,
upon his sui-name of Asella ,- i. e. a little ass. The poet prepares us for
this -witticism, such as it is, by the use of clitellas in the commencement
of megine, under which term the rolls above-mentioned are figuratively
referre to.

10—15. 10. Lamos. “ Fens.” Compare the Vet. Closs. “ Lamae.
πηλώδεις τόποι.”-1 1. Victor propositi simul ac, διε. “ As soon as thou
shalt have arrived there, aster having conquered all the difficulties of the
way.” The poet, both in this and the preceding line, keeps up the pun-
ning allusion in the name Asella.-l·2. Sub ala. ‘⁶ Under thy arm.''-—
14. Ut vinosa glomus, διο. “ As the tippling Pyrrhia the clew of pil-
fered yarn.'’ The allusion is to a comedy written by Titinius, in which
a slave, named Pyrrhia, who was addicted to drinking, stole a clew or
ball of 5arn, and carried it away under her arm. As Vinius had, with-
out doubt, been several times present at the representation of this piece.
Horace reminds him of that image which we may suppose had produced
the strongest im pression upon him. As regards the term glomus, (which
we have adopted aster Bentley, instead of the common glomos,) it may be
remarked, that the neuter form is decidedly preferable to the masculine,
and that the meaning also is improved by its being here employed—15.
Ut cum pileolo soleas conviva tribulis. “ As a tribe-guest his slippers and
cap.'' By conviva tribulis is meant one of the poorer members of a
tribe, and in particular a native of the country, invited to an entertain-
ment given by some richer individual of the same tribe. The guest, in
the true country fashion, proceeds barefoot to the abode of his entertainer,
with his slippers and cap under his arm, The former are to be put on
when he reaches the entrance, that he may appear with them in a clean
state before the master of the house. The cap was to be worn when
they returned ; for as they sometimes went on such occasions to sup at
a considerable distance from home, and returned late, the cap was neces-
sary to defend them from the injuries of the air. '

16—19. 16. Neu vulgo narres, ἃς. It is dangerous, observes Sana-
don, to prejudice the public in favour of a work. If it has beauties, per-
haps the reader would be better pleased to have had the liberty of disco-
vering them himself. If it has not, he cannot be long deceived, and we
shall only be rewarded by some of the reproach due to the authen—18.
Νῆα-ε porro. ‘⁶ Do thy best to succeed ;’' literally, “strive onward,’'
