xxiv METRES or HoRAcE.

Horace uniformly observes this construction, viz. two dactyls aud a semi-
foot. Ausonius, however, sometimes makes the first foot a spondee, and
twice uses a spondee in the second place3 but the spondee injures the
harmony of the verse.

4. Anomc *0

The Adonic, or Dactylic Dimeter‚ consiste of two feet, a dactyl and
spondee3 as,
Risit ἌῙρῦῖῖῦ.

Sappho is said to have written entire pocms in this measure, now lost.
Boethius has a piece of thirty—one Adonic lines, (lib. l, metr. 7,) of which
the following are a specimen :

Nubibus atris
Condita nullum
Fundere possunt
Sidera lumen.

Si mare volvens
Turbidus auster
Misceat aestum, (ξε.

The measure, however, is too short to be pleasing‚ unless accompanied by
one of a different kind. Hence an Adonic is used in concluding the
Sapphic stanza. (No. 10.) In tragic choruses it is arbitrarily added to
any number of Sapphics, without regard to uniformity. (Vide Senec-
Oedip. act 1 ς Troades, act 4; Herc. Fur. act 3 3 Thyes-t. act 3.)

lambio verses take their name from the Iambus†, which, ·in pure
Iambics‚ was the only foot admitted. They are scanned by measures
of two feet3 and it was usual, in reciting them, to make a short pause
at the end of every second foot, with an emphasis (arsis) on its final

silssffieiambic Trimeter (called likewise Senarz'us, from its containing

six feet) consists of three measures (metra). The feet which compone
it, six in number, are properly all iambi3 in which case, as above
stated, the line is called a puro iambic. The caesural pause most
commonly occurs at the penthemimeris3 that is, after two feet and a
half3 as, ὃ

The metres here end respectively where the double lines are marked,

ἰ This verse derives its name from the circumstance of its being used
by the Greeks in the music which accompanied the celebration of the
festival of Adonis: that part probably which represented the restoration of
Adonis to life.

’i‘ The term Iambus (Ἴαμβος) is derived, according ‘co some etymo-
logists, from ἷάπτω, “to injure‚” or, “attack,'' on account of its having
