sidered it as a kind of summary of the mles of good writing to be
gotten by heart by every student, and to whose decisive authority the
greatest masters in taste and composition must finally submit.” *Mn
Gifford, in the introduction to his translation of Juvenal, remarks, that,
‘⁶ as an ethical writer, Horace has not many claims to the esteem of
posterity; but as a critic he is entitled to all our veneration. Such is
the soundness of his judgment, the correctness of his taste, and the
extent and variety of his knowledge, that a body of criticism might be
selected from his works, inore peffect in its kind than any thing which
antiquity has bequeathed us.” of course, no person can dispute the
correctness or soundness of Horace's judgment 3 but he was somewhat
of a cold critic, and from his habits as a satirist‚ had aequired the Par-
nassian sneer. He evidently attached more importance to regularity of
plan, to correctness and terseness of style, than to originaljty of genius
or fertility of invention. He admitted no deviation stom the strictest
propriety; hc held in abhorrence every thing incongruous or misplaced ;
he allowed no pageantry on the stage, and tolerated nothing approaching
to the horrible in tragedy or the farcical in comedy. I am satisfied that
he would not have admired Shakspeare3 he would have considered
Addison and Pope as much finer poets, and would have included Falstaff,
Autolycus, Sir Toby Belch‚ and all the clowns and boasters of the great
dramatsst, in the same censure which he bestows on the Plautinos sales
and the Mimes of Laberius. Of poetry he talks with no great enthusi-
asm, at least in his critical works ; of poets in general he speaks at best
with compassion and indulgence3 of his illustrious predecessors in
particular, with disparagement aud contumely. In his ethical verses,
on the other hand, connected as they are with his love of a rural life of
tmnquilIity, freedom, and retirement, there is always something heartfelt
and glowing. A few of his speculative notions in morals may be erro-
neous‚ but his practical results are full of truth and wisdom. His philo—
sophy, it has been said, gives too much dignity and grace to indolence ;
places too much happiness in a passive existence, and is altogether
destructive of lofty views. But in the age of Horace, the Roman world
had got enough of lofty views, and his sentiments must be estimated not
abstractly, but in reference to what was expedient or salutary at the
time. After the experience which mankind had suffered, it was not the
duty of a moralist to sharpen the dagger of a second Brutus ; and max-
ims which might have flourished in the age of Scipio or Epaminondas,
would have been misplaced and injurious now. Such virtues, however,
as it was yet permitted to exercise‚ and such as could be practised with-
out danger to the state, are warmly and assiduously inculcated.

“ Horace,'' says Dryden‚ ‘⁶ instructs us how to combat our vices, to
regulate our passionS, to follow nature, to give bounds to our desires, to
distinguish betwixt truth and 'falsehood, and betwixt our conceptionsof
things and things themselves ; to corne back from our prejudicate
opinions3 to understand exactly the principles and motives of all our
actions; and to avoid the ridicule into which all men necessarily fall,
who are intoxicated with those notions which they have received from
their masters, and which they obstinately retain, without examining
whether or not they be founded on right reason. In a word, he labours
to render us happy in relation to ourselves, agreeable and faithful to our
friends, and discreet, serviceable, and well bred, in relation to those with
