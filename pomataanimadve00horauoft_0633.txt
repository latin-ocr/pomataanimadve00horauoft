Vos, Ο Pompilius sanguis! &a is discarded, and the second person
singular, Tu, Te, Tibi, ccc. invariably takes its place. The arguments,
too, are equally relative and person-ah, not only showing the necessity
of study, combined with natural genius, to constitute a poet3 but
dwelling on the peculiar danger and delusion of flattery, to a writer ol'
rank and fortune3 as well as the inestimable value of an honest friend,
to rescue him from derision and contempt. The l'oet, however, iu
reverence to the Mose, qualities his exaggerated description of an
infatuated scribbler with a nrost noble encomium on the use of good
poetry‚ vindicating the ‹lignity of the Art, and proudly asserting‚ that
the most exalted characters would not be disgraced by the cultivation
of it.

 

 

 

“ Nesoi-te pudori
Sit libi Mum, lyrae solers, et cantor Apollo.'’

It is worthy of observation, that, in the satirica] picture osa frantie
bard, with which Horace concludes his epistle, he not only runs
counter to what might be expected as a corollury of an lissay on the
Art of Paeo-31, but contradicts his own usual practice and sentiments.
ln his Epistle to Augustus, instead of stigmatizing the love of verse as
an abominable srenzy, he calls it a slis-,t numness (levis haec insania),
and descants on its good effects (quantus viz-tinea· habeat, sic collige l)—
In another Epistle, speaking of himself, and his attachment to poetry‚
he says,

“ ubi quid datur oti,

Illudo chortis,· hoc est mediocribus iltis
Ex uitiis unum,'' otc.

 

 

All which, and several other passages in his works, almost demonstrate
that it was not without a particular purpose in view that he dwelt so
forcibly on the description of a inan resolved

Of nature and his stars to write.⁷’

Various passages of this work of Horace have been imitated in Vida's
Poeticorum3 in the Duke of Buckingham’s Essny on Poetry5 in Ros-
common‚ On Translated l'e1·se; in l'ope's Essay on Criticism‚· and in
Boileau’s Art Poetique. The plan, however, of this last production is
more closely formed than any os the others on the model os Horace‘s
Epistle. Like the first division of the Ars Ροὲίίεα, it commences with
some general rules and introductory principles. The second book
touches on elegiae aud lyric poetry, which are not only cursorily
referred to by Horace, but are introduced by him in that part of his
Epistle which corresponds to this portion of the present work. The
third, which is the most important, and by much the longest of the
piece, chiefly treats, iu the manner of Horace, of dramatic poetry; and
the concluding book is formed on the last section of the Epistle to the
Pisos; the author, however, omitting the description of the frantie
