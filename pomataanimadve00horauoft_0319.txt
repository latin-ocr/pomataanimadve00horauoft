of wealth. had comment-ed in the age of Lucilius; hut virtue had still
further declined in that of Horace. Lucilius arraycd himself on the side of
those who affected the austerity of ancient manners, aud who tried to stem
the torrent of vice, which Greece and the Oriental nations even then began
to pour into the heart of the Republic. By the time of Horace, tho bul·
wark had been broken down, and those who rear-ed it swcpt away. Civil
war had burst asunder the bonds of society3 property had become insecure;
and the effect of this general dissolutiou remained even after the govern-
ment was steadily administered by a wisc and all-powersul dcspot. Rome
had become not only the seat of universal government and wealth‚ but also
the centre of attraction to the whole family of adventurers, the maguet
which was perpetually drawing within its circle the collected worthlessness
of the world. Expense, and luxury, and love of magnificence, had suc-
ceeded to the austerity and moderatiori of the ancient republic. Tho
example, too, of tho chief minister, inclined the Romans to indulge in that
voluptuous life which so well accorded with the imperial plans for the
stability and security of the government. A greater change of manners was
produced by the loss ofliberty, than even by the increase of wealth. The
voice of genuine srecdom had been last heard in the last Philippic of Cicero.
Some of the distinguished Romans, who had known and prized the repub-
lican forms of gowrnment, had fallen in the field of civil contention, or
been sacrificed during the proscriptions. Of those who suwived, many were
conciliated by benefits and royal favour, while others, in the enjoyment οι
the calm that followed the storms by which the state had been latcly
agitated‚ aequiesced in the imperial sway as now affording the only security
for property and life. Courtly compliance‚ in consequence, took place of
that boldness and independence which characterised a Roman citizen in the
age of Lucilius. The Senators had now political superiors to addi-ess, and
the demeanour which they had employed towards the emperor and his
advisere became habitual to them in their intercourse with their equale.
Hence, there prevailed a politeness of behaviour and conversation, which
differed both from the rougliness of Cato the censor, and from the open-
hearted urbanity of Scipio or Laelius. Satires, directed like those ot
Lucilius and the comic writers of Grccce, against political characters in the
state, were precluded by the unity and despotism of power. If Lucilius
arraigned in liis verses Mutius and Lupus, he was supported by Scipio and
Laelius, or some other heads of a faction. But in the time of Horace there
were uo political leaders except those tolerated by the emperor; and who
would have protected a satirist in the Augustan age from- the resentment οἱ
Maecenas or Agrippa?

The riso and influcnce of meu like Maecenas, in whom power and wealth
were united withrelegant taste and love of s'plendour, introduced what in
modern times has been called fashion. They of course were frequently
imitated in their villas and entertainments‚ by those who had no pretensions
to emulate such supcriors, or who vied with them ungracefully. The
wealthy freedman and provincial magistrate rendered themselves ridiculous
by this species of rivalry, and supplied endless topics of sportive satire3 for
it would appear that Maecenas, and those within the pale of fashion, had
not made that progr-ess iu true politencss, which induces either to shun the
society of such pretenders, or to cndure it without contributing to their
exposure. Hence the pictures of the self-importance and ridiculous dress
of Aufidius Luscus, and the entertainment of Nasidienus, to which Maece-
