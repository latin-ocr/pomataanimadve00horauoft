ment of the bow. The reference here, however, is not so much to these
people in particular, as to the Eastern nations in gener-d. In relation to
the Seres compare Explanatory Note, Ode 1. xii. 56.—11. Relabi posse.
‘¹ Cafflidc back.'' In this sentence WQQ is the dative by a
Graecism. ngse Latinity would require EQ. Some make mon-
tibus the ablativo, with which they join pronos in the sense of decur-
rentes. This arrangement is decidedly inferior to the one first given.
As regards the idea intended to be conveyed, it may be observed, that
the poet compares his friend's abandonment of graver studies for the din of
arms, to a total al-tgan of the order of nat-iffi. The expression

acquaintance with several eminent Romans, particularly Scipio and
