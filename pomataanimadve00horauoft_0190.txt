the consulship of Tullus.'’ Amphorae, ‘she dative, is put by a Graecism
for ab amphora. As regards the shape of the ancient amphorae, consult
Henderson’s IIistory of Wines. When the wine-vessels were filled,
and the disturbance of the liquor had subsided, the covers or stoppers
were secured with plaster, or a coating of pitch mixed with the ashes of
the vine, so as to exclude all communication with the externa] air.
After this, the wines were mellowed by the application os smoke, which
was prevented, by the ample coating of pitch or plaster on the wine-
vessel, from penetrating so far as to vitiate the genuine taste of the
liquor. Previously, however, to depositing the amphorae in the wine—
vault or ‘QPOUWQLQ was usual to put upon them a label or mark in-
dicative of the vintages, and of the names of the consuls in authority at
the time, in order that, when they were taken out, their age and growth
might be easily recognised. If by the consulship of Tullus, mentioned in
the text, be meant that of L. Volcatius Tullus, who had M. Aemilius
Lepidus for his colleague, A. U. C. 688, and if the present ode, as it
would appear from verse 17. seqq„ was composed A. U. C. 734, the
wine offered by Horace to his friend must have been more than forty-six
years old.
