the name Niphates contains an allusion, (Νιφάτης, quasi νιφετώδης,)
“ snowy.'’——21. Aletium flumen, ἃς. “ And how the Parthian river,
added to the list of conquered natione, rolls humbler wavcs.” By the
Parthian river is meant the Euphrates. The expression gentibus additum
victis is equivalent merely to in populi Romani potestatem redactum.—
23. Intraque praescriptum, διε. “ And how the Geloni roam, within the
limita prescribed to them, along their diininished plainS.’' The Geloni, a
Sarmatian race, having crosscd the Danube and laid waste the confines of
the empire in that quarter, were attacked and driven across the river by
Lentulus, the lieutenant of Augustus. Hence the use of the term prae-
scriptum, in allusion to the Danube being interposed as a barn'er by their
conquerors‘3 and hence, too, the check given to their ini-oads, which were
generally made by them on horseback, is alluded to in the expression
eoeiyuis equitare campis.

One X.-Addressed to Licinius Varro Murena, brother of Proculeius
Varro Murena mentioned in the second Odc (v. 5) of the present book.
Of a restless and turbulent spirit, and constantly forming new schenics of
ambition, Licinius was a total stranger to the pleasure inseparable from a
life of moderation and content. It is the object of the poet, therefore, to
pertray‚ in vivid colours, the security and happiness ever attendant upon
such a state of existence.

The salutary advice of the bard proved, however, of no avail. Lici-
nius had before this lost his all in, the civil contest, and had been
relieved by the noble generosity of Proculeius. Uniustructed by the
experience of the past, he now engaged in a conspiracy against Augus-
tus, and was banished, and afterwards put to death, notwithstanding all
tlhe interest of Proculeius, and Maecenas, who had married his sister

erentia.
