278 ΟΝ ROMAN SATIRE

fruits, was offered up every year to Ceres and Bacchus as the first
fruits of the season. This was termcd Satura 01· Satira, the word ἰαηι·
being understood. In like manner, a law containing several distinct parti-
culars or clauses, was denominatcd Lex Satura. 'From these examples,
the peculiar meaning of the term Satirae, in the case of Ennius, will be
clearly perceived.

After Ennius came Pacuvius, who took the former sor his model. So
few fragments, however, remaiu of his writingS, as to render it impossi-
ble for us to form any definite opinion of his satirical productioris.
Lucilius succeeded, and effected an important change in this species of
composition, by giving the preference, and iu some instances cxclusively
so, to the Hexameter verse. From the greater air of regularity which
this alteration produced, as well as from the more didactic form of his
pieces, in their aiming less at comic effect than those of Ennius, and
more at the improvement of others by the correction of vice, Lucilius,
and not Ennius, was regarded by many of the ancients as the father of
Satire. After his time, the Hexameter versification came to be regarded
as the proper garb for this speeies of poetry ; and the word Satire
passed from its primitive signification to the meaning given it at the
commeneement of these remarks, and which has been also retained in our
own days.

The finishing hand to Roman Satire was put by Horace. Thus far he
has been viewed as the great master of Roman Lyric Poetry‚ whether ama-
tory, convivial, or moral. We have still to consider him as a satiric,
huniorous, or familiar writer, in which character, (though he chiefly valued
himself on his Odes‚) he is more instructive, and perhaps equally pleasing.
He is also more of·an original poet in his Satires than in his Lyric composi-
tions. Daniel Heinsius, indeed, in his confused and prolix dissertation,
‘⁶ De Satira Horatiana‚'’ has pointed out several passages, which he
thinks have been suggested by the comedies and satiric dramas of the
Greeks. If, however, we except the dramatic form which he has given to
so many of his Satires, it will be difficult to find any general resemblance
between them and those productions of the Greek stage which are at pre-
sent extant. Satire had remained, 111 a great measure, uncultivated at
Rome, since the time of Lucilius, who imitated the writers of the Greek
comedy, in so sar as he unsparingly satirised the political leaders of the
state. But Horace did not live, like the Greek comedians, in an unre-
straincd democracy, nor, like Lucilius, under an aristocracy, in which there
was 3 struggle for power, and court was in consequence occasionally paid to
the people.

Satire, more than any other kind of poetry‚ is influeneed by the spirit
and manners of the age in which it appears. These are, in fact, the aliment
on which it feeds3 and, accordingly, in tracing the progress which had
been made in this species of composition, from the time of Lucilius till
the appearance of that more refined satire which Horace introduced, it
is important to consider the changes that had taken place during this
interval, both in the manners of the people and the government of the
country.

The accumulation of wealth naturally tends to the corruption of a land.
But a people, who, like the Romans, suddenly acquire it by war, con-
fiscations‚ and pillage, degenerate more quickly than the nations among
uhom it is collected by the slower processes of art, commerce, and in-
dustry. At Rome, a cozruption of morals, occasioned chiefly by an influx
