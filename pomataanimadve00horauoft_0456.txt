414 Q. HORATH FLACCI

Auriculae) tibi me virtus tua fecit amicum ,-

J us anceps novi, causas defendere possum ,-

Erz‘piet quivis oculos citius mihi, quam, te 35
Contemtum cassa nuce pauperet : haec mea cura est,

Ne quid tu perdas, neu sis jocus. Ire domum atque
Pelliculam curare jube 3 fi cognitor ipse.
Persta atque obdura, seu rubra Canicula findet

Gaudent praenomine molles auriculae. “ Delicate ears delight in hearing
the praenome11used.'' In addressing Roman citizens, the praenomen,
or first part of the name, was generally used, as being peculias to free-
men ; for slaves had no mammem—33. Virtus tua. ‘⁶ Thy great
merit.”——34. »Ius anceps· ‘⁴ All the knotty points of the law ;'' i. e.
susceptible of a double interpretation, and which a crasty advocate, aster
startiug‚ may easily convert to his client’s advantage—35. Quam te
contemtum cassa nuce pauperet. “ Than treat thee with contempt,
ancl defraud thee to the value of a nut-shell.'' Pauper-are literally
means “to impoverish ;'' here, however, it is taken in a stronger sense.
—27. Ire domum atque pelliculam curare jube. The connexion is as
follows: YVhen, by dint of language such as this, thou hast succeeded in
conciliating his good-will, ‘⁶ bid him go home, and make much of hjm-
self.” The phrase pelliculam curare is analogous to “ ,venio indulqere‚'’
—38. Fi connitor ipse. “ Do thou become his advocate ;'' i. e, do thou
take care of his cause sor him. Coym'lor is a term of the Roman law,
and the cofflzitores were those to whom the management of a suit was
entrusted by either of the parties, in the presence of the court, aster
which the latter might retire if they felt inclined.

39—44. 39. Persta atque obdura, ἃς. The idea intended to be
conveyed is simply this ε “ Persevere and hold out? through either
extreme of heat οι· cold. In expressing it, however, Horace, as usual,
seizes the opportunity of indulging more freely his satirical humour, and
throws well-merited ridicule on two silly specimens of contemporary
versification. In the first of these, statues recently made were termed
infantes, (·'‘ infant‚—young‚'') a ludicrous image, which the poet here
pru-odies in a very amusing manner, by applying the same epithet to
wooden statues, just finisloed, and made of quite fresh materials, so as to
split, in consequence, under the intense heat of the dog-days. Who the
author of this curious metaphor was, which is thus so deservedly laughed
at, we have no certain means of ascertaining. He is generally sup- -
posed, however, to have been none other than F un'us Bibaculus, to
whom, as the text informs us, the second of these strange poetic thoughts
unquestionably belongs, In this last-mentioned one, Jupiter was de-
scribed as spitting forth snow upon the Alps 3 an idea low, harsh, and
extravagant. To render his parody of this the more severe, Horace
substitutes Furius himself for the monarch of the skies; and, to prevent .
au mistake‚ applies to the former a laughable species of designation, , “
drawn (lirectly from his personal appearance (pinyui tentus omaso,
“ distended with his fat paunch”). According to the scholiast‚ the line of
Bibaculus, which we have just been considering, occurred in the begin- Ἰ’.ς
nlng of a poem which he had composed on the Gallie war, and ran as l
