HORA'rlUs.
Stoice, post damnum sic vendas omnia pluris : 300
Quam me stultitiam, quoniam non est genus unum,
Insanire putas ἲ ego nam videor mihi sanus.

DAMASIPPUS.

Quid? caput abscissum manibus quum portat Agaue
Gnati infelicis, sibi tum furiosa videtur?

IIORATIUS.

Stultum me fateor, liceat concedere veris, 305
Atque etiam insanum : tantum hoc edissere, quo me

Aegrotare putes animi vitio.
DAMAsnu’US.
Accipe: primum
Aedificas, hoc est, longos imitaris, ab imo
Ad summum totus moduli bipedalis; et idem

Arma; alluding to the precepts just laid down by the Staio—298,
Totidem audiet. “Shall hear as much of himself.”-Atque respicere
iynoto discet, διο. “ And shall learn to look back at the things which
hang behind him, and of which he is ignorant.” Some explain this pas-
sage by a reference to verse 53, “ caudam trahat.'’ It is better, how-
ever, to regard it, with other commentators, as an allusion to the fable of
AZsop, which says, that Jupiter threw over the shoulder of every mortal
two bags ; that the faults of his neighbour were put into the bag before
him, and his own into that behind him.

300—309. 300. Stoice, post damnum, διο. The poet wishes, as
Torrentius and Sanadon remark, that Damasippus may sell every thing
hereaster for more than it is worth ; a wish that insults the honest wis-
dom of a philosopher. Thus, in covert ternis, he advises him to return
to his merchandise, and trouble his head no more about philosophy.
Damasippus understands the ridicule, and is very sufficiently, though
with not too much delicacy‚ revenged.--303. Λῃαιιε. This female, in-
spired with Bacchanalian fury, tore in pieces her son Pentheus, whom
she mistook for a wild beast, and carried his head about with her as a.
trophy of the animal which she supposed had been destroyed by her.—
308. AEdificas. Wieland supposes that Horace, about this time, was
improving the appearance of his Sabine farm, which he had received as
a gist from his patron, and converting the small fami-house that stood
on it into a kind of villa. This excited the ill-will of his enemies at
Rome, and, as Maecenas at this same time was erecting his splendid
residence on the Esquiline, they charged the poet with an attempt to
ape the conduct of his superiors. It is to this that Horace pleasantly
alludes, under the character of Damasippus.—Lon90s. “The great.’'
There is a pun in this word, as opposed to moduli bipedalis, since it
means tall as well as yreat. Horace was of diminutive stature, as he
himself acknowledges.-309. Et idem corpore majorem, ἃς. “And yet
