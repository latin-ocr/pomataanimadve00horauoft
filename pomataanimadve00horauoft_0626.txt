582 Q.. HORATII FLAccr

Emtum coenat olus, quamvis aliter putat ; emtis
Sub noctem gelidam lignis calefactat aenum ;
Sed vocat usque suum, qua populus adsita certis 170
Limitibus vicina refugit jurgia3 tanquam
Sit proprium quidquam, puncto quod mobilis horae,
Nunc prece, nunc pretio, nunc vi, nunc morte suprema,
Permutet dominos et cedat in altera jura.

Sic, quia perpetuus nulli datur usus, et heres 175
Heredem alterius velut unda supervenit undam,
Quid vici prosunt aut horrea? Quidve Calabris
Saltibus adjecti Lucani, si metit Orcus
Grandia cum parvis, non exorabilis auro?

in ancient Etruria. It lay to the north-east of Rome, but its exact
position was never clearly ascertained until Holstenius directed the
attention of antiquaries to the spot known by the name of Z’Isola Far-
uese, and situate about a mile and a half to the north-east of the modern
post-house of la &orta—170. Sed vocat usque suam, qua populus adsita,
&Q ‘⁶ And yet he calls the land his own, as far as where the planted
poplar prevents quarrels among neighbours, by means of the limit which
it fixes.” Usque must be joined in construction with qua, as if the
poet had said usque eo qua—171. Refugit. The peculiar force of the
perfect here is worthy of notice ; literally, “ lias hitherto prevented‚ and
still continues to pre vent.”—17·2. Sit proprium. “ Can be a lasting pos-
session.''—Puncto mobilis horae. “ In a fleeting hour's space,'' i. e. in
the short space of a single hour.

undam. “ And one man's he. „- urges 011 anotheffs, as wave impels
wave.’' The Latinity of allerias, which Bentley and Cuningham have
both questioned (the former reading alternis, and the latter ulterior),
is, notwithstanding the objections of these critics, perfectly correct.
The poet does not refer to two heirs merely, but to a 'long successiou
of thern ; and in this line of descent only two individuals are each
time considered, namely, the last and the present possessor.—-177. Vici.
“Farnis.''—Quidve Calabris saltibus adjecti Lucani? Or what, Lu-
canian joined to Calabrian pastures ?'' i. e. so wide in extent as to
join the pastures of Calabria—178. St metit Orcus yrandia cum parvis,
&a ‘⁶ lf death, to be moved by no bribe, mows down alike the high
and the lowly.''—180. Marmor, ebur. The allusion is to works in
marble and ivory.—-Tyrrhena sigilla. ‘⁴ Tuscan vases.'' The term sz'yilla
properly denotes small statues or figures ; the reference here, how-
ever, is to the small figures that appear on vases, or in other words, to
the vases themselves. The Etrurians excelled in the different branches
of the plastic art—Tabellas. ‘⁶ Paintings.” Understand pietas—181
Aryentum. Vases, and other like articles of silver, are meant.- Vestes
Gaetulo murice tinctas. “ Coverings and tapestry stained with Gaetulian
