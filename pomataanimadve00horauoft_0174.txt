134 Q. HORATII FLACCI

“ Marti redonabo. Illum ego lucidas
Inire sedes, discere nectaris
Succos, et adscribi quietis 35
Ordinibus patiar deorum.

‘⁵ Dum longus inter saeviat Ilion
Romamque pontus, qualibet exsules
In parte regnanto beati :
Dum Priami Paridisque busto 40

“ Insultet armentum, et catulos ferae
Celent inultae, stet Capitolium
F ulgens, triumphatisque possit
Roma ferox dare jura Medis.

“ Horrenda late nomen in ultimas 45

“ An object of dread—46. Medius liquor. “ The intervening waters.”
—48. Arva. Understand Aeyypli.

pertum is here to be taken as a general epithet of aurum. The common
translation, “as yet undiscovered‚'’ involves an absurdity.—51. Quam
cogere, ἃς. ‘⁴ Thau in bending it to human purposes, with a n'ght hand
plundering everything of a sacred ehmeter.” The expression omne
sacrum rapiente dextra is only another definition for boundless cupidity,
which respects not even the most sacred objects. Among these objecta
gold is enumerated, and with singular felicity. It should be held sacred,
