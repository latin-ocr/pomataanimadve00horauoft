464 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Invidia vel amore vigil torquebere. Nam cur,
Quae laedunt oculum, festinas demere: si quid
Est animum, differs curandi tempus in annum 2
Dimidium facti, qui coepit, habet ,- sapere aude, 48
Incipe. Qui recte vivendi prorogat horam,
Rusticus exspectat, dum defluat amnis 3 at ille
Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis aevum,
Quaeritur argentum, puerisque beata creandis
Uxor, et incultae pacantur vomere silvae. 45
Quod satis est cui contigit, hic nihil amplius optet.
N on domus et fundus, non aeris acervus et auri
Aegroto domini deduxit corpore febres,
N on animo curas. Valeat possessor oportet,

Phaeacians did, would have been as dishonourable to a freeman as ap-
pearing abroad intoxicated in the public streets. To get up, therefore,
before break of day, for the purposes of mental improvement, was not
requiring too much of a young man of family like Lollius, who was
desirous of acting a distinguished part on the theatre of life, and who
would, therefore, feel the strongest inducement to put in operation this
good old rule of former days—37. Vigil. ‘⁶ In thy waking moments ;''
i. e. after thou shalt have extended thy slumbers into the middle of the
day. The allusion in the words invidia vel amore is not merely to these
passions in particular, but to all the depraved desires and affections
which mental culture, and the pursuits of philosophy, can alone drive
away.

39—43. 39. Est animum. ‘⁶ Preys upon the mind.''—40. Dimi-
dium facti, qui coepit, habet. · Compare the Greek proverb, ἁρχὴ ἥμισυ
παι’τός.-4“2. Rusticus erspeclat, dum defluat amnis, ἃο. With rusticus
suppl)⁷ ut or sicuti.—The leading idea in the comparison here instituted
is as follows: He who neglects the present season for sels-improvement,
and keeps waiting for some more favourable opportunity to arrive, waits
in vain, like the rustic on the river's bank, who foolishly thought that the
stream would fiow by and become exhausted 3 for time, like that stream,
glides- along in rapid course, and the hour which has once passed will
never return—43. Volubilis. “ Rolling on.'’

44—54. 44. Quaeritur argentum, puerisque, ἃς. The connexion in
the train of ideas is as follows ι The bulk of mankind, however, pay little
if any attention to mental culture and the lessons of wisdom and virtue.
Their chief object of pursuit is the accumulation of wealth.-Puerisque
beata creandis uror. ‘⁴ And a rich and fruitful sponse.'' It may be
doubted whether pueris creandis, as here employed, should be at all
translated, and whether it is not rather a mere formal expression, bor-
rowed from the language of the Roman nuptials.—45. Pacantur. “Are
subdued.'' The poet, by the use of this term, would seem to ridicule the
excessive desire on the part of the Romans of extending their cultivated
grounds, so as to strive to subject to the plough the more stubbom soils,
and even to bend the forests to its sway.—48. Deduxit. ‘⁴ Can remove;”
