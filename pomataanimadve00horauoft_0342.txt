302 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Postulat, ignoscet verrucis illius,· aequum est,

Peccatis veniam poscentem reddere rursus, 75
Denique, quatenus excidi penitus vitium irae,

Cetera item nequeunt stultis haerentia: cur non

Ponderibus modulisque suis ratio utitur 2 ac res

Ut quaeque est, ita suppliciis delicta coercet?

Si quis eum servum, patinam qui tollere jussus 80

Semesos pisces tepidumque ligurrierit jus,

In cruce suffigat, Labeone insanior inter

Sanos dicatur. Quanto hoc furiosius atque

Majus peccatum est? Paulum deliquit amicus;

Quod nisi concedas, habeare insuavis3 acerbus 85

Odisti, et fugis, ut Rusonem debitor aeris,

Qui nisi, quum tristes misero venere Kalendae,

Mercedem aut nummos unde unde extricat, amaras

“ He shall be placed in the same balance ; '’ i. e. his failings shall be
estimated in return by me with equal ki11dness.’'—-76. Denique, quatenus
excidi, διε. “ Finally, since the vice of anger cannot be wholly eradicated.''
The second part of the Satire begins herm—77. Stultis. The Stoics

and maa—78. Ponderibus modulisque suis. ‘⁴ Her weights aud
measures.’'-Res ut quaeque est. ‘⁶ According to the nature of each
particular case;” i. e. as each particular case 1·cquircs.—80. Tollere.
“To take away,'' i. e. from table-81. Liyurrierit. In the sense of
deyustaverz't.-—82. Labeone. Itis altogether uncertain what individual
the poet here intends tc designate. ι

83-89. 83. Quantofziriosius‚ ἃς. “ How much more insane, and
how much greater than this, is the crime of which thou art guilty.'' Hoc
is here the ablative, not the nominative, and refers to the cruel conduct
of the master towards his slave. The crime alluded to in peecatum is
stated immediately after, Paulum deliquit amicus, δια-85. Con-
cedas. “ Overlookcst.”-Insuavis. ‘⁴ Unkind.''—86. Rusonem. Ruso
was a well-known usurer, and at the same time prided himself on his
literaly talents. When his debtors were unable to pay the principal or
‚the interest that was due, their only way to mitigate his anger was to
listen patiently to him while he read over to them his wretched historical
productione. He was thus, as Francis well observes‚a double torment:
he ruined the poor people who borrowed money by his extorum, and he
read them to death with his works.—8 7. Tristes Kalendae. The Calends
are here called tristes, or gloomy, in allusion to the poor debtor who
finds himself unable to pay what he owes. Money was lent among the
Romans from mouth to mouth, and the debtor would, of course, be called
upon for payment of the principal or interest ou the Calends of the ensu-
