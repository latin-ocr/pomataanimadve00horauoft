EPISTOLA AD PISon. ¹ G‘Jl

Unde parentur opes ; quid-alat formetque poetam ;

Quid deceat, quid non,· quo virtus, quo ferat error.
scribendi recte sapere est et principium et fons.

Rem tibi §ocraticae poterunt ostendere chartae : 310
Verbaque provisam rem non invita sequentur.

Quo sit amore parcns, quo frater amandus et hospes,

Quod sit conscripti, quod judicis officium, quae

Reddere personae scit convenientia cuique.

Respicere exemplar vitae morumque jubebo

Doctum imitatorem, et veras hinc ducere voces,

ψ310. Socraticae chartam—“The precepts os Socratic wisdorn.” The
poet sends us to the precepts of Socrates, as contained in the moral
writings of Plato und others of his disciple53 for Socrates wrote nothing
himself. (ΖΜ-[ρ is therefore taken here, as Diiring well explains it,

of, things3 . falsehood, that which, however suitable to the particular
instance in view, does yet not corre-spond to such general nature. T ὀ
