Nempe incomposito dixi pede currere versus

Ut non hoc fateatur? At idem, quod sale multo

Urbem defricuit, charta laudatur eadem,

Nec tamen hoc tribuens dederim quoque cetera ; nam sic 5
Et Laberi mimos ut pulchra poemata mirer.

Ergo non satis est risu diducere rictum

Auditoris: et est quaedam tamen hic quoque virtus:

Est brevitate opus, ut currat sententia, neu se

Impediat verbis lassas onerantibus aures : 10

Et sermone opus est modo tristi, saepe jocoso,

1—14. 1. Nempe incomposito, &c. “ Ι did indeed say that the
verses of Lucilius ran not smoothly along.’⁷ Compare Serm. 1. iv. 8.
where Lucilius is described as being ‘⁶ durus componere versus.''—2,
Tam inepte. “ To so foolish a degree.’'—3. Quod sale multo urbem
defricuit. “ For having lashed the town with abundant humour.’'—4.
Charta eadem. ‘⁴ In the same piece‚” i. e. in the same satire.-6.
Laberi. Laberius was a Roman knight of respectable family aud cha-
racter, who occasionall'y amused himself with the composition of what
were called Mimes. These were a species of drama, to which mimetic
gestures of every kind, except dancing, were essential, as also the ex*
hibition of grotesque characters which had often no prototypes in real
life. The titles, and a few fragments of sorny-three of the Mimes of
Laberius are still extant; but, excepting the prologue, these remains are
too inconsiderable and detaehed to enable us to judge of their subject
or merits: Horace condemns, in the present passage, an admiration of
the Mimes of this writer3 but Horace does not appear to have been an
infallible judge of true poetic excellence. He evidently attae-hed more
importance to correctness and terseness of style, than to originality of
genius or fertility of invention. Probably, too, the freedom of the pro-
logue, and other passages of his dramas, contributed to draw down the
disapprobation of the Augustan cutim—8. Et est quaedam tamen, ἃς.
“ Tho-ugh there is a certain kind of merit even in this 3 '’ i. e. in exciting
the laughter of au audience.—-9. Neu se impediat verbis, διο. “ And
may not embarrass itself by a multitude of words, that only serve to load
the wearied ears.''—ll. Et sermone opus est, διο. “ There is need, wo,
ofa style at one time grave, at another, playful3 now assuming the cha-
racter of an orator or a poet, at times that of a refined and polished
