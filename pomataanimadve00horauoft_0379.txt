differcnce ;” literally, “could alone separate them.”.-15. Duo si dis-
cordia vemet inertes. “ Whereas, ifdiscord set two faint-licarted men
in action.‘'—16. Diomedi cum Lycio Glauco,- alluding to the exchange
ofarmour between Glaucus and Diomede.—l7. Piyrior. “ The wcaker

18-19. 18. Bruto Practore tenente, &e. Brutus was Praetor when
ne took part in the assassination of Julius Cacsar. Asia formed, in fact, a
proconsular provinee; that is, its governor was to be a man of consular
rank. In the confusion, however, which succceded the death of Caesar,
this rule, with many others of a similar nature, was not of course accu-
rately complied witl13 and the Roman senate, who, amid all their weakness
and timidity, still felt convinced that their only hope of restoring the republic
rested with Brutus, exertcd themselves to strengthen his hands by provin—
cial appointuients. He received, therefore, first, the government of Crete,
as propraetor, afterwards that of Macedonia, and, A. U. C. 711, the pro-
vince of Asia, a part of which, however, he had first to reduce to his
authority by force of arms. It is evident, therefore, that Horace uses the
term praetore, in the text, in the sense of “ Govern0r;'⁷ (Pr-opraetore
would have been unmanageable in verse ς) and with the more propiicty in
the present instance, as Brutus never had obtained a higher rank in the
republie than the Praetorian. —19. Rupili et Persi par puynat. ‘⁶ The
pair, Rupilius and Persius, enter the lists.'' “ Our idiom rejects the geni-
tive (⁴‘ the pair of Rupilius and Persius‚”) which in the original conveys an
air of peculiar elegant-e to the clause, being based upon the expression par
gladiatorum— Uti non compositi melius cum Bitho Bacchius. “ With
so much spirit, that the gladiators Bacchius and Bithus were not more
equally matched.''

Maynum spectaculum uterque. “ Each a very diverting spectacle.''—-
22. Βέάέιαν ab omni conventu. “ He is laughed at by the whole assem-
bly.” Conventus here included all who were present at the hearing of
the casa—23. Cohortem. “ His retinue.”-·24. Solem Asiae. As illum-
