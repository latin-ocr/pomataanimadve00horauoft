LIFE AND CHARACTER OF MAECENAS*.

-ο-

Onus &Cumas Max-:cums was descended, it is said, from Elbius
Volterrenus, one of the}ucumones of Etruria, who fell in the battle
at the lake Vadimona, A. U. C. 445, which finally brought his country
under total subjection to the Romans. His immediate ancestors
were Roman knights, who, having been at length incorporated into
the state, held high commands in the armyt, and Maecenas would
never consent to leave their class to be enrolled among the Senators ;
but he was proud (as may be conjectured from its frequent mention
by the poets) of his supposed descent from the old Etrurian princes.
It is not known in what year he was born, or in what manner he

Augustus, and he gave chasg with them to Anto—ny when he fied aster

Maecenas, in virtue of his office of Prefect, was entrusted with the
chief administration of affairs inita-122 and particularly with the civil
government of the capital§. After Augustus had returned from
Egypt, without a rival, and the affairs of the empire proceeded in a
regular course, Maecenas shared xvi-th {3315pr the favour and confi-
dence of his sovereign. While A-grippa was entrusted with affairs
requiring activsty, grQ, and force, those which were to be accom-
