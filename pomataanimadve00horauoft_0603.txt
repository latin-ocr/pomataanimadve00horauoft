EPISTULARUM LIB. 11. 1, 559

Sudoris minimum, sed habet Comoedia tanto
Plus oneris, quanto veniae minus. Adspice, Plautus 170

Quo pacto partes tutetur amantis ephebi ;

Ut patris attenti ; lenonis ut insidiosi :

Quantus sit Dossennus edacibus in parasitis;

Quam non adstricto percurrat pulpita socco.

Gestit enim nummum in loculos demittere, post hoc 175
Securus, cadat an recto stet fabula talo.

Quem tulit ad scenam ventoso Gloria curru,

Exanjmat lentus spectator, sedulus inflat.

a work of by so much the greater toil, as it has less reason to hope for
pardon to be cxtended to its fanlts. Horace's idea is this : In tragedy
the grandeur of the subject not only supports and elevates the poet,
but also attaches the spectator, and leaves him no time for malicious
remarks. It is otherwise, however, in comedy, which engages only by
the just delineation that is made of sentiments and characters—170.
Adspice, Plautus quo pacto parces tutetur amantis ephebi, sce. “See in
what manner Plautus supports the character of the youthful lover;
how, that of the covetous father; how, that of the cheating pimp.”
Horace, the better to show the difficulty of succeeding in comedy,
proceeds to point out the faults which the most popular comic writers
have committed.

The allusion is still to Dossennus, who, accordjng to the poet, was
81101111νο only to the acquisition of gain, altogether unconcerned about
the fate of his pieces after this object was accomplished.—l't'7. Quem
tulit ad scenam ventoso gloria curru, &c. Horace, as Hurd remarks, here
ironicany adopts the language of an objector, who, as the poet has very
satirically contrived, 15 left to expose himself 111 1110 very terms of his
objection. He has just been urging the love of money as another cause
that contributed to the prostitution of the Roman comic muse, and has
been blaming the venality of the Roman dramatic writers in the person
of Dossennus. They had shown themselves more solicitous about fil!-
ing their pockets, than deserving the reputation of good poets. But,
instead of insisting farther on the excellence of this latter motive, he
stops short, and brings in a bad poet himself to laugh at it. ‘⁶ What ζ)
Is the mere love of praise to be our only object? Are we to drop all
inferior considerations, and drive away to the expecting stage in thc
puffed mr of vain glory? And why ? To be dispirited or inflated,
us the capr-icious spectator shall think fit to withhold or bestow his
applause. And is this the mighty benefit of thy vaunted passion for
fame? No; farewell the stage, if the breath of others is that on which
the silly batd is made to depend for the contr-action 01 enlargement of
his dimensions.'’ To all this concine-ing rhetoric the poet condescends
to interpose 110 objection, well knowing that no truer service is, often-
times, done to virtue or good sense, than when a knave or fool is left to
himself to employ his idle raillery against either.
