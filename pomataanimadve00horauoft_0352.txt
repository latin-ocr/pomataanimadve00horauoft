312 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Belli fi’rratos postes portasque rcfreyit .·’'

Invenias etiam disjecti membra poetae.

invenias membra disjecti politae, ut si solvas (hos versus Ennii). The
term eliam is here equivalcnt to puriter,· and the meaning of 1118 poet 15,
that the lines composed by Lucilius and himself become, when divested
of number and rhythm, so much prose, and none will find the scattered
fragments animated with the true spirit of poetry‚ as he will, if he take.
