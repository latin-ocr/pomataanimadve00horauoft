Quid ἲ si quis vultu torvo ferus, et pede nudo,
Exiguaque toga, simuletque ex ore Catonem,
Virtutemne repraesentet moresque Catonis?
Rupit Iarbitam Timagenis aemula lingua, 15
Dum studet urbanus, tenditque disertus haberi.
Decipit exemplar vitiis imitabile: quod si
Pallerem casu, biberent exsangue cuminum.
O imitatores, servum pecuS, ut mihi saepe
Bilem, saepe jocum vestri movere tumultus! ‘20
Libera per vacuum posui vestigia princeps3

at the folly of those who imagincd that, by indulging freely in wine,
they would be enahlcd to sus-min thc character of poets.

12-15. 12. Quid? si qais vultu tori-oji’rus, &a The idea intended
to be conveyed is this: a person might justas soon think of attaining
to the high reputation of (fato Uticensis, by aping the peculiarities of
dress and appearance which characterizcd that remarkable man, as of
becoming a poet by the mere quaffing of xvim—15. Rupit Iarbitam
Timayenis aemula Ιὶηφια. “ The emulous tongue of Timagenes caused
Iarbita to burst, while he desires to be thought a man of wit, and to Be
regarded as eloquent.'' Timagenes was a rhetorician of Alexandria,
who, being taken captive by Gabinius, was brought to Rome, where
Faustus, the son of Sylla, purchased him. He afterwards obtained his
freedom, and was honoured with the i'avour of Augustum but as he
was much given to raillery, and obscrved no measure with any person,
he soon lost the good graees of his patron, and, being compelled to
retire from Rome, ended his days at Tusculum. lt would appear, from
the expression aemula linqua, that the‘wit and the declamatory powers
of Timagenes carried with them more or less of mimici-y and imitation.
On the other hand, Iarbita was a native of Africa, whose true name was
Cordus, but whom the poet pleasantly stylos lrtrln'la (“ the descendant
of Iarbas,'’ i. e. the Moor), from Iarbas, king of Mauritania, the fablcd
rival of AEneas, and perhaps with some satirical allusion to the history
of that king. Now the meaning of Horace is this: that Iarbita burst by
imitating Timagenes in what least descrved imitation ; for hc imitated
what was ill about Timagenes, not what was good. He copied his
personal sarcasm, and, in endeavouring to equal his powers of declama-
tion also, he confounded them with mere strength of lmrgs, and spoke
so loud ut rumperet ilia. Hence, both in relation to this case, as well
as to those which have preceded it, the poet adds the remark, Decipit
eoeemplar vitiis imilabile. “ An example, easy to bc imitated in its
saules, is sure to deceive the ignorant.’'

18—31. 13. Eaesanyue cuminum. “ The pale-making cumin.'' Dios-
eorides assures us, that cumin will make people pale who drink it or
wash themselves with it. Pliny says it was reported that the disciples
of Porcius Latro, a famous master of the art of speaking, used it to
imitate that paleness which he had contracted by his studies—19. Gt
