appearance in court on a certain day. Hence vadatus, the participle of
this deponent, becomes equivalent, as in the present case, to petitor, or
plaintiffi—With regard to the time of day mentioned by the poet
(quarta jam parte diei praeterita) it may be remarked, that as the
Roman day was divided into twelve hours, the fourth partos the day would
correspond to the third hour, or nine o'clock in the morning with us.
At this honr the courts of law opened, according to Martial; (“ eoeercet
‘raucos tertia causidicos.” Epiy. iv. 8 3) and the companion of Horace,
therefore, when he reached the temple of Vesta, was after the time when
he ought to have been present in court—37. Quod ni fecisset, perdere
litem. “ And if he did not do this, he would lose his cause.'' Perdere
is governed by debebat understood. According to the rule of the Roman
law, if the defendant was -not in court when the case came on, he was
said deserere vadimonium, and the praetor put the plaintiff in.possessiou of
his effects. The present case, however, would seem to have been one
in which the defendant had bound himself to pay acertain sum, equa}
to the amount in controversy, if he forfeited his recognizance. As he
did not appear at the time stipulated, judgment went against him by
default; and henceanew action arises on the recognizance. To coni-
pel his attendance at this new suit, the plaintiff goes in quest of him,
and, on finding, drags him to court. Compare note on verse 76.

38—44. 38. Si me amas. This must not be read si m’amas, but si
me‘ amas: in other words, the long vowel in me parts with one of its
short component vowels before the initial vowel of amas, and retains the
otiien—Paulum hic ades. “ Help me here a little.’' Adesse, in the
legal phraseology of the Romans, was equivalent to patrocinari. It is
here used in this δῶκα-39. Stare. This term, like adesse in the pre-
ceding line, is used here in a legal sense, and is equivalent to advocati
partes sustinere. Hence the reply made by Horace is as follows:
“ Mayl die, if Ι am either able to act the part of an advocate, or have
any acquaintance whatever with the laws of the state.'’-Novi. The
peculiar propriety of this term on the present occasion is worthy of
notice. N oscere is to be acquainted with anything as an object of per-
ception3 and the poet therefore wishes to convey the idea, that he is so
great a stranger to the laws as not to know even their very form and
language.— 41. Rem. ‘⁶ My suit.”—Me, sodes. “ Me, I beg.'' Sedes
is contracted for si audes.—42. Ut. In the sense of siquidem or quando-
quidem. ‘⁶ Since.”—43. Maecenas quomodo tecum 52 “ How is Maece-
