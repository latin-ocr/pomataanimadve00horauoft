Si puerilius his ratio esse evincet amare, 250

“ Madness will be the impelling motive ;” i. e. all will pronounce hini
mad—250. Si puerilius lzis ratio, nc. ‘⁶ If reason shall clearly prove,
that to love is more puerile even than these, and that it makes no differ-
ence, whether thou raise, in the dust, such childish works as thou for-
merly didst when three years old, 0r‚'' ἃς. Stertinius here passcs to the
madness of those who arc cnslavcd by the passion of love. The ques-
tion put by the Stoic is as follows : If reason shall clearly establish the
point, that they who love are guilty of even greater puerilities than those
just enumerated, will it not be better for lovers to follow the example of
Polemon, and, by changing entirely their feelings and sentiments, enter
on a wiser and a better course of life ‚0—253. Quod olim mutatus Pole-
mon. “ What the reformed Polemon once did.” Polemon was au
Athenian of distinction, who in his youth had been addicted to infamous
pleasures. As he was one morning, about the rising of the sun, return-
ing home from the revels of the night, clad in a loose robe, crowned with
garlands, strongly perfumed, and intoxicated with wine, he entered the
school of Xenocrates, with the intention of turning the philosopher and
his doctrine to ridicule. The latter, however, dexterously changed his
diseourse to the topics of temperance and modesty, which he recom-
mended with such strength of argument and energy of language, that
Polemon, heartily ashamed of the contemptihle figure which he made in
so respectable an assemffly, took his garland from his head, concealed
his naked anu under his cloak, assumed a sedate and thoughtful aspect,
and, in short, resolved from that hour to relinquish his licentious plea-
sures, and devote himself to the pursuit of wisdoni. With such ardour
did he apply himself to his studies as to succeed Xenocrates in his
school.

254—257. 254. Insiynia morbi. “The marks of thy distemper.”
The distemper here alludcd to is the mania of debanchery and illicit
plemma—955. Fasciolas, cubital, focalia. “ Thy rollers, clbow-cushion,
mufflers.” These properly were confincd to women, and only adopted
by the more effeminate of the other sex. The Fasciolae were pieces of
eloth or other material, with which the effeminate youth of the day, in
imitation of the women, covered their arms and legs, wrapping them
around their limbs like bands or rollers. The Romans, it will be recol-
lected, wore neither stockings nor any under-garment for the hips and
thighs.—The Cubital was a cushion or small pillow, for supporting the
elbow of the effeminate when reclining at an entertainment. Some,
however, understand by the term, a kind of fore-sleeve, extending from
the elbow downward, and others a species of short cloak, descending as
far as the elbow‚ and with which the head might be covered, if requisite ;
used properly by those who were in feeble health.-'l¹he Focalia (quasi
