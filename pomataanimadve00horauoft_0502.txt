106—108. 106. Ad summam. “ To conclude.''—Sapiens um minor
est Jove, &c. The idea with which the poet intends to conclude his
epistle is this, that he alone is happy who regulates his life by the
maxims of wisdom. In order to express this, he adopts the language
which the Stoics of the day were fond of using in reference to the
superior privileges of their wise man. As the Stoics, however, carried
their notions of their wise man to a ridiculous length, it is easy to per-
ceive that Horace, though he embraced what was good in the philoso—
phical tenets of ,this sect, could not give in to their ridiculous paradoxeS.
Hence the piece of raillery with which the epistle terminantes—108.
Praecipue scmus, διο. The Stoics regarded a sound and healthy frame
as among the many advantages which their discipline conferred. But
after alluding to this, the poet sarcastically adds, m'si quum pituita
molesta est ; meaning to imply, that there were occasions when the wise
man of the Stoics was brought down to the level of the common herd.
In order to comprehend the full force of the raillery here employed,
we must bear in mind, that they who labour under any defluxion of
phlegm experience at the same time a dulness in the senses of smell
and taste 3 and that this, applied in a figurative sense to the intellect,
couveys the idea of an unfitness for any subtle examination of things,

or any nice exercise of judgment. Hence it will be perceived, that ’

sanus in the text is purposely used in an ambiguous sense, as referring
not merely to the body, but also to the mind—Pituita. To be pro-
nouuced' m metrical reading as a trisyllable, pitwita.

EPISTLE II W—Horace having retired for some time into the country,
had taken the opportunity of that soh'tude to read ov er Homer again
with particular attention, and, writing to his friend Lollius at Rome,
sends him his remarks upon that poet, and an explanation of what he
