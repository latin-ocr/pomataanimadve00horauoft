SERMONUM LIB. 1. 5. 323

Ex voto Laribus, quaerebat; scriba quod esset,

Nihilo deterius dominaejus esse. Rogabat

Denique, cur unquam fugisset? cui satis una

Farris libra foret, gracili sie tamque pusillo.

Prorsus jucunde coenam produximus illam. κ’)
Tendimus hinc recta Beneventum, ubi sedulus hospes

Paene macros arsit dum turdos versat in igne.

Tum rapere, atque omnes restinguere velle videres.

Nunquam erepsemus, nisi nos vicina Trivici

elegant and pleasing than those which have gone before. There being no
chimney, and the bustling landlord having 'made a largcr fire than usual,
the flames caught the rafters of the building. On ihc want of chimueys

the wind Atabulus parchesJ’ The Atabulus was a northerly wind, cold
and parching, which frequently blew in Apulia. Etymologists deduce the
name from ἄτη and βάλλω-7 9. Ε repsemus ; for erepsissemus.— Trivici.
Trivicum wasa small place among the mountains separating Samnium fron]
Apulia. The vehicles that contained the party were compelled to turn off
