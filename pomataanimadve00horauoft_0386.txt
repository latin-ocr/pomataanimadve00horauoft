346 Q,- HonArn FLAcm

Manaret talos. Ο te, Bolanffi cerrbri

Felicem! aiebam tacitus, quum quidlibet ille

Garriret, vicos, urbem laudaret. Ut illi

Nil respondebam, Misere cupis, inquit, abire,

Jamduclam video, sed nil “958³ usque tenebo, 15
Persequar. Hinc quo nunc iter est tibi ‚9-Nil opus est te
Circumayz' ; quendam volo visere non tibi notum ;

Trans Tiberim Zonye cubat is, prope Caesaris hortos.—
Nil habeo qaod affirm, et ozon sum piger ; usque sequar te.—
Demitto auriculas ut iniquae mentis asellus, 20
Quum gravius dorso subiit onus. Incipit ille:

Si bewe me novi, non Viscum pluris amicum,

lVon Varium facies ; nam quis me scribere plures

Aut citius possit versus ,9 qui-5· membra movere

Mallius ? invideat quod et Hermoyems, ego canto. 25
Interpellandi locus hic eras—Est tibi mater 2

11—21. 11. Ο te, Boiam, &c. “ Ah! Bolanus, murmured 1 to
myself, happy iu thy irritable temper !'’ According to the scholiast, the
iudividual' here alluded to was a man of irritable and fiery temper, who
had a summary mode of getting rid of such aequaintances, by telling them
to their faces what he thought of them—15. Sed nil aqis, usque tenebo.
“ But it is all in vain. I am determined to stick close by thee.” This is
meant for a bon mol by the poet’s persecutor.—16. Persequar. ‘⁵ Ι will
follow thee wherever thou goest.'’ The true meaning of this verb, how-
ever, is best expressed by the vulgar phrase, “ Ι will follow thee through
thick and thiu.”—Hinc quo nunc iter est tibi 52 ‘⁴ Whither does thy
route lie now from this quarter Ρ ”--18. Cubat. ‘⁴ He is confined to his
bed.”—-Caesarz's hortos. The reference is to the gardens of Julius Caesar,
which he left by his 'will to the Roman people. (Sueten. Vit. Caes. 83.)
They were situ-:te on the right bank of the 'siben—19. Piyer. “ In a
lazy mood.'‘— Usque sequar te. ‘⁴ I will accompany thee as far.”—-20.
Ut iniquae mentis asellus. “Like a surly young ass.'’—2l. Quum
pravius dorso subiit onus. The construction iS‚ quum subiit (i. e. iit
sub) gravius onus dorso. “ When a beavier load than ordinary i‘s put q
upon his back :'' literally, “When he goes under a beavier load than
ordinary with his back.”

22—28. 22. Viscum. There were two brothers named Viscus, of
senatoriau rank, and sous ofVibius Viscus a Roman knight‚ who stood high
iu favour with Augustus. They were both distinguished by their liter-ary
talents, and both are named by Horace in the loth Satire of this Book,
among those persons whose good opinion was to him a source of grati-
fication. From the present passage it would appear, that, at this time,
he was particularly intimate with one of the twa—Q. Quis membra
movere mollius? &c. “ Who can dauce more gracefully? My singing
wo, even Hermogenes would euvy.” Consult note on Serm. ι, vi. l.
