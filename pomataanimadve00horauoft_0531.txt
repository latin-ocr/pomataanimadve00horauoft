Sulcos et vineta erepat mera, praeparat ulmos,

Immoritur studiis, et amore senescit habendi. 85

Verum ubi oves furto, morbo periere capellae,

Spem mentita segeS, bos est enectus arando :

Offensus damnis, media de nocte caballum

Arripit, iratusque Philippi tendit ad aedes.

Quem simul adspexit scabrum intonsumque Philippus, 90

Durus, ait, l ultei, nimis· attentusque videtis

Esse mihi. -Pd, me mise) um, pali om, vocares,

Si velles, inquit, verum milei ponere nomen.

Quod te per Genium ‹laenamque› deosque Penates

Obsecro et obtestor, vitae me redde priori. :15
Qui semel adspexit, quantum dimissa petitis

Praestent, mature redeat repetatque relicta.

Metiri se quemque suo modulo ac pede verum est.
