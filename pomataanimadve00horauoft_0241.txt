CARMINUM LIB. IV. 4. 201

Doctrina sed vim promovet insitam,
Rectique cultus pectora roborant ε
Utcunque defecere mores, :35
Indecorant bcnc nata. culpae.

Quid debeas, o Roma, Neronibus,
Testis Metaurum flumen, et Hasdrubal
Devictus, et pulcher fugatis
Ille dies Latio tenebris, 40

Qui primus alma risit adorea,
Dirus per urbes Afer ut Italas,
Ceu flamma per taedas, vel Eurus
Per Siculas equitavit undas.

Post hoc secundis usque laboribus 45
Romana pubes crevit, et impio
Vastata Poenorum tumultu
Fana deos habuere rectos :

of the term 1Vero, which was of Sabine origin, and significd “courage,”
“ firmness of soul.’'—30. Patrum virtus. “ The spirit of their sircs.''-
33. Doctrina sed vim, διο. The poet, after conceding to the young Neros
the possession of hereditary virtues and abilities, insists upon the necessity
of proper culture to guido those powers into the path of usesulness; and
hence the fostering care of Augustus is made indirectly the theme of praise.
The whole stauza may be translated as follows : “ But it is cducation that
improves the powers implanted in us by nature, and it is good culture that
strengthens the heart: whenever moral principles are wanting, vices degrade

achieved by C. Claudius Nero over the brother of Hannibal .-38. ,Metau-

Metaurus, now Metro, a river of Umbria„ emptying into the Adriatic, was
rendered memor-able by the victory gained over Asdrubal by the consuls
C. Claudius Nero and M. Livius Salinator. The chief merit of the victory
was due to Claudius Nero, for his bold and decisive movement iq marching
to join Livius.—39. Pulcher ille dies. ‘⁴ That glorious day.'' Pulcher
may also be joined in construction with Latio, ‘⁶ rising fair on Latium.’'
According to the first mode of interpretation, however, Latio is an abla-
tive3 tenebris suyatis Latio, “ when darkness was dispelled from Latium.’'
—4l. adorea. Used here in the sense of victoria. It properly means a
distribution of corn to an army, after gaining a victory.—42. Dirus per
urbes, διο. “ Since the ‹lire son of Afric sped his way through the Italian
cities, as the flame does through the pines, or the south-east wind over the
sicilian waters.” By diris A fer Hannibal is meant.-45. Laboribus ‚-
