325 Q. HORATII FLAcel

Nec, quod avus tibi maternus fuit atque paternus,
Olim qui magnis legionibus imperitarent,

Ut plerique solent, naso suspendis adunco

. Ignotos, ut me libertino patre natum.

Quum referre negas, quali sit quisque parente
Natus, dum ingenuus : persuades hoe tibi vere,
Ante potestatem Tulli atque ignobile regnum
Multos saepe viros nullis majoribus ortos 10

introduction to that minister. He also descants on the virtue and
frugality of his own life 3—he mentions candidly some of his foibles, and
describes his table, equipage, and amusements. Here every particular
is interesting. We behold him, though a courtier, simple in his plea-
sures; and in his temper and his manners, honest, warm, and candid, as
the old Auruncan. (Dunlop's Roman Literature, vol. iii. p. 251.)

1—10. 1. Non. quia, Maecenas, διε. The order of construction is
as follows: BIaecenas, non, ut plerique solent, suspendis adunco naso
iynotos, ut me natum libertino patre, quia nemo Lydorum, quidquid
Lydorum incoluit Etruscos fines, est yenerosior te, nee quod maternus
atque paternus avus fuit tibiqui olim imperitarent maynis legionibus.
‘⁶ Maecenas, thou dost not, as most are wont to do, regard with a sneer
persons of lowly birth, εις, for instance. me the son of a freedman,
because no one of the Lydians that ever settled in the Etrurian terri-
tories is ofnobler origin than thou, nor because thou hast maternal and
paternal ancestorS, who in former days commanded powerful armies.'’
The idea intended to be conveyed is simply this: Though of the
noblest origin, O Maecenas, thou dost not, as most others do, regard
high extraction as carrying with it a right to sneer at the low-born.—
Lydorum quidquid Etruscos, &c. It was the popular belief that Etruria
had been colonised from Lydia. Horace means, by the language of the
text, to describe the origin of Maecenas as equalling, if not surpassing,
in nobility, that of any individual in the whole Etrurian nation.—4.
Leyionibus. The term leyio is here put, Romano more, for exercitus.
—5.¹ Naso suspendis adunco. This, in a literal translation, is precisely
equivalent to our vulgar phrase, “to turn up the nose at one.'' Thus,
“thou dost not, as most are wont to do, turn up thy nose at persons
of lowly birth.”--8. Dum ingenuus. “Provided he be a man of
worthff’ There is a singular beauty in the use of the term inyenuus
on the present occasion. By inyenuz', among the Romans, were meant
those who were born of parents that had always been free. The poet,
however, here applies the epithet to a higher kind of necdum, that of
the mind and of the heart; a freedom from all moral contamination,
and a nobility of thought and aetion, in respect of which the nobly born
are sometimes even the vilest of slaves.—9. Tulli. Servius Tullius.—
Iynobz'le reynum‚· an allusion to the servile origin of this monarch.
The idea which the poet intends to convey is this, that, before the reign
of Tullius, many individuals, as meanly born as himself, had often
obtained honours equally as high, and led a life equally as praiseworthy.
—10. Nullis majoribus ortos. “ Sprung from no long line ofancestors,'’
i. e. of obscure birth. Nullis is here cquivaicnt in spirit to iynohilihus.
