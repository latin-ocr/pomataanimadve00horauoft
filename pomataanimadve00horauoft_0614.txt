570 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Prudens emisti vitiosum , dicta tibi est lex :
Insequeris tamen hunc, et lite moraris iniqua.
Dixi me pigrum proficiscenti tibi, dixi 20 ,
Talibus officiis prope mancum ,- ne mea saevus
Jurgares ad te quod epistola nulla veniret.
Quid tum profeci, mecum facientia jura
Si tamen attentas? Quereris super hoc etiam, quod
Exspectata tibi non mittam carmina mendax. 25
Luculli miles collecta viatica multis
Aerumnis, lassus dum noctu stertit, ad assem
Perdiderat: post hoc vehemens lupus- et sibi et hosti
Iratus pariter, jejunis dentibus acer,
Praesidium regale loco dejecit, ut aiunt, 30
Summe munito et multarum divite rerum.
Clarus ob id factum, ,donis ornatur honestis 3
Accipit et bis dena super sestertia nummum.

having once been a fugitive, though he had endeavoured, by his lan-
guage, to soften down the offence —18. Prudens emisti vitiosum ; dicta
tibi est lex. “ Thou hast purchased, with thine eyes open, a good-for-
nothing slave ; the condition of the bargain was expressly told thee ;”
12'. e. his having once been a fugitiva—19. Hzmc5 alluding to the
slave—dealer.—20. Dioei me plyrzcm proficiscenti tihi, δῖε. The con-
nexionin the train of ideas is as follows: Thou hast no better claim
on me in the present instance, than thou wouldst have on the slave-
dealer in the case which Ι have just put. Ι told thee expressly, on thy
departure from Rome, that I was one of indolent habits, and totally
unfit for such tasks, and yet, notwithstanding this, thou complainest of
my not writing to thee l—ssl. Talibus officiis prope mancum. “ That I
was altogether unfit for such tasks 3⁹⁷ hterally, “that 1 was almost
deprived of hands for such tasks.” A strong but pleasing expression.
-23‚ Quid tum profeci, ἃς. “ What did Ι gain then, when I told thee
this, if notwithstanding thou assailest the very conditions that make
for me ?³'—‘24. Super Iz-oc. “llloreover.''-—-·25. Mendaoe. “False to
my promise.”

26—40. 26. Luculli miles, ἃς. We have here the second excuse
that Horace assigns for not writing. A poet in easy circumstances
should make poetry no more than an amusement-Commta viatica
multis aerumnis. “ A little stock of money which he had got together
by dint of many hardships.” The idea implied in viatica is, something
which is to furnish the means of future support as well as of present
comfort, but more particularly the former.—Ad assem. “Entirely,”
or more literally, “to the last penny.”—30. Praesidium reyale loco deje-
cit, ut aiunt, &a “He dislodged, as the story goes, a royal garrison,
from a post very strongly fortified, and rich in many things.” The allu-
sion in reyale is either to Mithridates or Tigranes, with both of whom
Lucullus carried on wan—32. Bonis honestis,- alluding to the torque-3,
