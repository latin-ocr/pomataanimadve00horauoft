EPISTOLA AD Plsoxrs. 631

Reges dicuntur multis urguere culullis‚

Et torquere mero, quem perspexisse laborant, 435·
An sit amicitia dignus ε si carmina condis

Nunquam te fallant animi suh vulpe latentes.

Quintilio si quid recitares, C orri ye sodes

Hoc, aiebat, et 7200. Melius te posse negares, ἱ

Bis terque expertum frustra, delere jubebat, 4110
Et male tornatos incudi reddere versus.

Si defendere delictum, quam vertere, malles,

Nullum ultra verbum aut operam insumebat inanem,

Quin sine rivali teque et tua solus amares.

Vir bonus et prudens versus reprehendet inertes, 445
culpabit duros, incomtis allinet atrum

Transverso calamo signum, ambitiosa. recidet

Ommenta, parum claris lucem dare coget,

Arguet ambigue dictum, mutanda notabit3

Fiet Aristarchum non dicet ; Car (³90 amicum 450
Offendam in vzzcyis ‚2 Hae nugae seria ducent

“ Than those who grieve from their hearts ;'' i. e. who sincerely grieve-

deeeitful and crafty flatterers.-—438. Quintilio. Quintilius Varus, to

“Thy badly—polished verses.''—-444. Sine rivali. The man who does
what others are not willing to imitate, may well be said to be without a

particularly suited Horace’s purpose to paint the severe> and rigid judge
of composition—446. Incomtis allinet atrum, διο. “ To those that are
badly wrought he will affix a black mark, by drawing his en across
them.”—447. calamo. Consult note on Sat. 11. iii. 7.—450. ristarchns.

for his impartiality as a judge of literary merit: Hence every severe
critic was styled an Aristarchus.—451. Hae nugae seria ducent in mala,
