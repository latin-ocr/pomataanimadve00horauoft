632 Q. HORATH FLACCI

ζ In mala derisum semel exceptumque sinistre.
Ut mala quem scabies aut morbus regius urguet,
Aut fanaticus error, et iracunda Diana,
Vesanum tetigisse timent fugiuntque poetam, 455
Qui sapiunt; agitant pueri, incautique sequuntur.
Hie dum sublimis versus ructatur, et errat,
Si veluti merulis intentus decidit auceps
In puteum foveamve, licet, Succurrite, longum
Clamet, Io cives Ι ne sit, qui tollere curet. 460
Si curet quis opem ferre, et demittere funem,
Qui scis, an prudens huc se projecerit, atque
Servari nolit? dicam, Siculique po'e'tae
Narrabo interitum. Deus immortalis haberi

Dum cupit Empedocles, ardentem frigidus Aetnam 465
Insiluit. Sit jus liceatque perire poetis.

Invitum qui servat, idem facit occidenti.

Nec semel hoc fecit 3 nec, si retractus erit, jam

Fiet homo, et ponet famosae mortis amorem..

Nec satis apparet, cur versus factitat ; utrum 470

453—471. 453. Ut mala quem scabies, &a The order of construc-
tion is as follows : Qui sapim? eum, timent tetigisse fugiuntque vesanum
pois‘tam, ut illum quem mala scabies, cxc. Mala scabies. “A leprosy.'’
—-Morbus regius. “ The jaunnlicess’ So called because the patient
must live delicately, and like a king 01· wealthy person.—45fi. Ayz'tant.
“ Worry him.”—457. Sublimis. “ with head erect.''-459. Longum.
“ In lengthened tone.''—462. Prudens. “ Of his own accord-‘'——465.
Empedocles. The story about Empedocles is rejected as fictitious by
Strabo and other writers—Frigidus. “In cold blood ;’' i. e. delibe-
rately. Horace, by playing on the words ardentem fiigidus, would
show, remarks Francis, that he did not believe the story, and told it as
one of the traditions which poets may use without being obliged to
vouch for the truth of them. The pleasantry continues when he says,
it is murder to hindei· a poet from killing himself.—467. Idem facit
occidenti. “ Does the same thing with one that kills him ;'' i. e. does
the same as kill him. Occidente is put by a Graecism for cum occidente,
or, more elegantly, ac occidens—468. Nec semel hocfecit. “ Neither is
it the first time that he has acted thus ;'’ i. e. he has done this before,
and will do it agaim—469. Homo. “ A reasonable being;”‘ i. e. a per-
son of sane mind—470. Cur versus jactitet. “ Why he is all the time
making verse5.”— Utrum minxerit in patrios cineres. “ Whether he has
defiled his father’s ashes.⁷' The dead and their graves were ever held
sacred and inviolable among all nations‚ especially those of near rela-
tions. The meaning then of the whole clause will be this: Whether
he has been visited with madness from heaven for some great enormity.
