vii. 101, and 11. vi. 20. Horace is not afraid to call Maecenas himself as
a witness of his disintercstedness and gratitude. Thou hast often,
says he, commended me sor a moderation which could alone set bounds
to thy liberality. Thou knowest that Ι ever spoke of thee in the lan-
guage of tendemess and respect, as my friend and benefactorae-lr'ere-
cundum. It will be perceived from the foregoing note, that we have,
with Lambinus, referred this term to the moderation of the poet amial
the favours of his patron. Most commentators, however, make it allude
merely to his modesty of deportment.—Rea'que Paterque. The first of
these appellations refers to the liberality, the second to the kind and
friendly feelings, of Maecenas toward the bard.

39—45. 39. Inspice, si possum donata reponere laetus. “ See whe-
ther I can cheerfully restore what thou h¹1st given me. ” The connexion
in the train of ideas' 1s as follows. I said just now, that if the f1ble oi
the field· -mouse were applicable to my own case,1 was perfectly willing
to resign all the fav ours which thy kindness had conterred upon me. Try
me then, my patron, and see whether I am sincere in what Ι have said.

the offspring of the patient Lly sses. This answer of Telemachus is
taken from the fourth book of the ()(ἰ)55 sey, and was made to Menelaus,
who urg ed him to accept a present of h'orses. The applicationis obvious:
Tibur, or Tarentum, was our poet' s Ithaca, where Maecenas s gifts could
be of no more use to him than the present of Menelaus to Telemachus.
—41. Non est aptus Ithace locus, &e Horace has here expressed
Hom. Od. 4. 601. seqq.-Ut neque planis porrectus spatiis, &c. “ As
it is neither extended in plains nor abounds with much grass.”—45.
Vacuum Tibur. “The calm retreat of 'riburff' The epithet vacuum
is here equivalent in some respect to otiosum and designates Tibur as a
place of calm retreat for the poet, and of literary leisure.—Imbelle

Tarentum. “ Τ1ιε peaceful Tarentum.''
48—48. 46. Strenuus et fortis· “Active and brave.” The allu-

sion in the text is to Lucius Marcius Philippus, of whom Cicero makes
frequent mention. He was equally distinguished for eloquence and cou-
rage, which raised him to the censorship and consulship. The little tale
’ here introduced 18 the longest, but not the least agreeable, of the three
with which Horace has enliv ened his letter. Itis told with that natural
