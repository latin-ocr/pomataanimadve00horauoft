SERMONUM LIB. 1. 3. 303

Porrecto jugulo historias, captivus ut, audit.

Comminxit lectum potus, mensave catillum 90

Evandri manibus tritum dejecit : ob hanc rem,

Aut positum ante mea, quia pullum in parte catini

Sustulit esuriens, minus hoc jucundus amicus

Sit mihi? Quid faciam, si furtum fecerit? aut si

Prodiderit commissa fide? sponsumve negarit? 95
Queis paria esse fere placuit peccata, laborant,

Quum ventum ad verum est : sensus moresque repugnant :

Atque ipsa utilitas, justi prope mater et aequi.

Quum prorepserunt primis animalia terris,

Mutum et 'turpe pecus, glandem atque cubilia propter loo

some way or other.‘⁷—Amaras ‚· equivalent to ‘mepte scrzptas.—89.
Porrecto juyulo. Ruso reads his unfortunate hcm-er to death with his silly
trash3 and the poor man, stretching out his neck to listen, is compared to
one who is about to receive the bloxv of the executioner.-—Audit. ‘¹ Is
compelle-d to listen to.'’

91—95, 91. Evandri manibus tritum. ‘⁵ Fashioned in relies by the
hands of Evander ;'' i. e. adorned with work in relies. As regards the
Evander here mentioned, the scholiast informs us that he was a distin-
guished artist, carried from Athens to Alexandria, by Marc Autony, and
thence subsequently to Rome. Some commentators, however, understand
by the expression Evandri manibus tritum a figurative allusion to the
great antiquity of the article in question, as if it had been worn smooth‚ as
it were, by the very hands of Evander, the old monarch of carly Roman
story.—95. Commissa fide. ‘⁴ Secrets confided to his honour.'’ ‘Fide is
here the old form of the dative. Compare Ode 111. vii. 4.—Sponsumve
neyarit. ‘² Or has broken his word.''

96—110. 96. Queis paria esse seve placuit, &c. Tho poet bere
begins an attack on the Stoic sect, who maintained the strange doctrine
that all offences were equal iu enormity. According to them, every
virtue being in conformity to nature, and evely vice a deviation from it,
all virtues and vices were equal. One act of beneficence, or justice, is
not more truly so than another3 one fraud is not more a fraud than
anothcr3 therefore there is no other difference in the essential nature of
moral actions, than that some are viciens, and others virtuosa—97.
Quum ventum ad verum est. ‘⁴ NVhen they come to the plain realities of
life.’'-Sensus moresque. “ The general sense of mankind and the
2stablished cuatonis of all nations.'’.-99. Quum prorepserunt, &c.
Horace here follows the opinion of Epicurus respecting the primitive
state of man. According to this philosopher, the first race of men rose
out of the earth, in which they were formed by a mixture of ‘neat and
moisture. Hence the peculiar propriety of prorepserunt in the text.—
100. Mutum. By this epithet is meant the absence of articulate language,
and the possession merely of certain natural eries like other animals.
According to Epicurus and his folloxvers, articulate langnage was an
improvement upon the natural language of man, nroduced by its general
