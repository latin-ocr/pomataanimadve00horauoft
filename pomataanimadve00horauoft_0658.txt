should seem from this, that the common characters of Comedy, as well
as the gods and heroes of Tragedy, had a place in the Satyric Drama,
as cultivated in the days of Horace. Davus is the name of a slave in
Terence. Pythias is the name of a female slave in the Eunuchus
of the same author, and also, as the scholiast informs us, in one of
the comedies of Lucilius.—238. Emnncto lucrata Simone talentum.
“ Having gained a talent from Simo whom she has wiped.’' The poet
purposely employs the low comic word emuncto, as suited to, and in
keeping with, the subject of which he treats—239. Silenus. The poets
make him the governor and foster-father of Bacchus, and represent
him as borne upon an ass—240. Er noto fictum carmen sequar, «Sec.
“ From a well-known subject Ι will produce such a fiction that,” &c.
Sequar is here equivalent to exsequar. This precept, observes Hurd
(from line 240 to 244), is analogous to that before given (line 219)
concerning tragedy. It directs to form the Satyric Dramas ont of a
known subject. The reasons are, in general, the same for both. Only
one seems peculiar to the Satyric Drama. For the cast of it being
necessarily romantio, and the persons for the most part those fantastic
beings called Satyrs, the τὸ ὅμοιον, or probable‚ will require the subject
to have gained a popular belief, without which the representation must
appear unnatural. Now these subjects, which have gained a popular
belief, in consequence of old tradition and their frequent celebration
in the poets, are what Horace calls nota ; just as newly-invented
subjects‚ or, which comes to the same thing, such as had not been
employed by other writers, indicta, he, on a like occasion, terms ignota.
The connexion, therefore, is as follows. Having mentioned Silenus
in line 239, one of the commonest characters in this species of drama,
an objection immediately offers itself ; “but what good poet will en*
gage in subjecte and characters so trite and hacknied ?” the answer is,
er noto fictum carmen sequar,· i. e. however trite and well-known this
and some other characters, essential to the Satyric Drama, are, and ¹
must be, yet will there be still room for fiction and genius to show
themselves The conduct and disposition of the play may be wholly
