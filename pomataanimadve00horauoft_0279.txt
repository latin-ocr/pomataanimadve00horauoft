CARMEN IV.

Lums et agnis quanta sortito obtigit,
Tecum mihi discordia est,

Ibericis peruste funibus latus,
Et crura dura compede.

Licet superbus ambules pecunia, · 5

Centaur Nessus, slain by one of the arrows of Hercules.—19. Si quid
unquam, ὅτε. “If thou shalt ever desire such food as this‚” ἰ. e. such
food as garfic. concupiveris is equivalent in spirit to comederis—20.
Jocose‚ This epithet is here used, not with reference to the general
character of Maecenas, but simply in allusion to the practical joke which
he had played off at the expense of the bard. Compare Introductory
Remarks.

Epona IV.—Addressed to some individua] who had risen amid tho
troubles of the civil war from the condition of a slave to the rank of mili-
tary tribune and to the possession of riches, but whose corrupt morals and
intolerable insolence had made him an object of universal detestation.
The hard indignantly laments that such a man should be enabled to d'is-

my part towards thee, Ο thou whose back has been galled by the Iberian
lash, and whose legs have been lacerated by the hard setter,·as falls by
nature to the lot of wolves and lambs.’'—3. Jbericis funibus ,· alluding
to a lash composed of ropes made of the spartum or Spanish broom.—4.
Dura compede. Among the Romans, the worst kind of slaves were
compelled to work in setters, as well in the ergastulum, or work-house,
as in the fields.—7. Sacram metiente te Viam. “As thou struttest
proudly along the sacred Way.” The term metiente well describes the
affected dignity of the worthlcss upstart, in his measuring, as it were, his
very steps—Sacram Viam. The sacred Way was a general place of
