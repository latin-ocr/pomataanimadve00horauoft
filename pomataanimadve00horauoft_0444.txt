402 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Corpore majorem rides Turbonis in armis 310
Spiritum et incessum : qui ridiculus minus illo?

An quodcunque facit Maecenas, te quoque verum est,
Tantum dissimilem et tanto certare minorem?

Absentis ranae pullis vituli pede pressis,

Unus ubi effugit, matri denarrat, ut ingens 315
Bellua cognatos eliserit. Illa rogare,

Quantane? num tantum, se inflans, sic magna fuisset 2-
Major dimidia—Num tantum 3—-Quum magis atque

Se magis inflaret 3 Non, si te ruperis, inquit,

Par eris. Haeo a te non multum abludit imago. 320
Adde poemata nunc, hoc est, oleum adde camino 3

Quae si quis sanus fecit, sanus facis et tu.

Non dico horrendam rabiem.

thou art wont to laugh at the fierceness and the martial air of Turbo
when in arms, as too great for his stature-'⁹ Turbo was a brave but
diminutive gladiator.

312—324. 312. Te quoque verum est. Supply facere. Verum is
here equivalent to rectum or ‹equum—313. Tantum dissimilem et tanto
certare minorem. ‘⁴ So unlike and so ill-fitted to vie with him.” Μηθ-
rem certare is a Graecism.—3l4. Absentis ranae pullis, διο. Although
this fable is not to be found among those that remain to us of AEsop'S,
yet there is every probability that it is one of his. Phaedrus, however,
recounts the fable in a different manner. He tells us that a frog, seeing
a bull in the meadow, became jealous of his bulk, and began to blow
herself up that she might rival him. Horace's manner is by far the
more lively.—3l5. flIatri denarrat. “ He tells his mother all the
particulars.” The verb denarro is happily chosen.—-3l6. Ooynatos.
“ His brothers ;” equivalent here to una secum natos.-317. Num
tantum. Supply &hyena-321. Oleum adde camino. A proverbial form
of expression, and equivalent here to insaniae nova alimenta praebe.
Horace, according to Damasippus, is mad enough already z if, in addi-
tion to this, he goes on writing verses, the increase of madness will be so
violent, that it may fitly be compared to the flame which fiercely arises
when oil is thrown upon the sira—322. Quae si qui-s· sanus fecit, sanus
sacis et tu. The idea intended to be conveyed is, that all poets are
unsound in mind. The ancients would seem to have believed, indeed,
that no one could either be a genuine poet, or great in any department
of exertion, unless he left the beaten traek, and was influenced by some
