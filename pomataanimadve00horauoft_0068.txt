13—19. 13. Quin et Atridas, &a ‘⁴ Under thy guidame, too, the
rich Priam passed unobservfflj„ the haughty sons of Atreus ;'' alluding to
the visit which the aged monarch paid to* the Grecian camp in order to
ransom the corpse of Hector. Jupiter ordered Mercury to be his guide, and

mum him unobserved and in safety to the tent of Achilles. (Consult
Homer, Il. xxiv. 336. seqq.)-]4. Dives Priamus ‚· alluding not only
to his wealth generally, but also to the rich ›resents which he was bearing
to Achilles.—]5. Thessalos ignes. ‘⁶ llie lhessalian watch-fnes3'' re-
ferring to the watches and troops of Achilles, through whom Priam had to
pass in order to reach the tent of their lenden—16. Fefellz't. Eqnivalent
here to the Greek ἔλαθεν.-]7. Tu pias laetis, διε. Mercury-is here
represented in his ‘ffifsst-important character, as the gnide of departed
spirits. Hence the epithets of ψυχοπομπός and νεκροπομπός so often
applied to him. The verb reponis, in the present stanza, receives illus-
tration as to its meaning from the passage in virgil, where the future
descendants of Aeneas are represented as occupying abodes in the land
of spirits previously to their being summoned to the regions of day.
(Aen. vi. 756. seqq.)—18. Viryaque lez-em coerces, &m An allusion
to the caduceus of Mercury.-19. Super-'‘z's—cssorum ; a Graecism for

Superis ns.

Onn XI. Addressed to Leuconoe ; by which fictitious name a female
friend of the poet's is thought to be designated. Horace, having discovered
that she was in the habit of consulting the astrologers of the day, in order
to ascertain, ifpossible. the term both oflie'ffffiv‘nss as well as his, ⁴existence,
entreats her to abstain from snc'u idle inquiries, and leave the events of the

future to the wisdom of the gods.

1-4. l. Tu ne quaesieris. “Inquiro not, 1 entreat.'' The suh-
junetive mood is here used as a sostened imperative, to express entreaty
or request3 and the air of carnestness with which the poet addresses his
female friend is increased by the insertion of the personal pronunti.—
2. Finem. “Term of existence.”-—Ba Ionios numeros· “Chaldean
tables.” The Babyloniam, or, more sfflfffpffiffn-gfffhe chaldeam,
