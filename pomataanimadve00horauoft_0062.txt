22 Q. HOR'ATII FLACCI

Tiburis umbra tui. Teucer Salamina patremque
Quum fugeret, tamen uda Lyaeo

Tempora Q fertur vinxisse corona,
Sic tristes affatus amicos:

Quo nos cunque feret melior Fortuna parente, 25·

Ibimus, o socii comitesque !
Nil desperandum Teucro duce ef, auspice Teucro 3

Certus enim promisih Apollo
Ambiouam tellure nova Salamiua futuram.

O fortes, pejoraque passi 30
Mecum saepe viri, nunc vino pellite curas:

Cras ingens {tgr-abimus aequor. „s
