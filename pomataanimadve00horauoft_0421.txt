Slc raro scribis, ut toto non quater anno

Sarma III.—Horace here converses with a Stoic, who was well
known at Rome for the extravagant opinions which he entertained. In
this fictitious dialogue the pretended philosopher adduces the authority of
a brother charlatan, to prove that all mankind are mad, with the excep-
tion of the stoical sage. They deal out folly to every one in large por-
tions, and assign Horace himself his full share. The various classes of
men, the ambstious, luxurious, avaricious, and amorouS, are distributed
by them, as it were, into so many groups‚ or pictures‚ of exquisite taste
and beauty, in which are delineated‚ with admirable skill, all the ruling
passions that tyrannize over the heart of man. Some of their precepts
are excellent, and expressed in lively and natural tcrms ; but occasional
bursts of extravagance show that it was the object of the poet to turn
their theories into jest, and to expose their interpretation of the principles
established by {he founders of their sect. (Dunlop's Roman Literature,
vol. iii. p. 256.

1-7. 1. Scribis. The allusion is to the composing of verses—2.
Membranam. ‘⁵ Parchment.”-—-Scriptorum quaeque reterens “ Re-
touching each of thy former productions.'' Retexo is properly applied to
the operation of unweaving: it is here metaphoric-any used for correcting
and retouching a work—3. Beniynus. ‘⁶ Prone to indulge in.''-4.
Dignum sermone. “ Worthy of mention.”—Quid fiet? “ What is to
be done Ρ ” ι’. e. what dost thou intend doing 3> wilt thou write then, or
not ?-Ab ipsis Saturnalibus huc suyisti. The train of ideas is as fol-
lows: One would imagine, indeed, from thy conduct, that the former of
these plans had been adopted, and that thou wert actually going to -
write, for “thou hast fled hither,'' to the retirement of thy villa, “from
the very feast of Saturn itself.”—Huc refers to the poet's Sabine villa,
whither he had retired from the noise and confusion attending t'ne cele-
bration of the Saturnalia in the streets of the capital.—5. Sobrius. “ In
sober mood ;” i. e. amid the sober tranquillity and the retirement of thy
villa—6. Incipe. Aster uttering this, Damasippus is supposed to pause
a while, waiting for the poet to begin the task of composition. At
