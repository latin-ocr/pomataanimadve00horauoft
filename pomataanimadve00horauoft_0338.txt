298 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Evenit, lnquirant vitia ut tua rursus et illi.
Iracundior est paulo 3 minus aptus acutis
Naribus horum hominum3 rideri possit, eo quod 30
Rusticius lonso toga defluit, et male laxus
In pede calceus haeret : at est bonus, ut melior vir
Non alius quisquam 3 at tibi amicus3 at ingenium ingens
Inculto latet hoc sub corpore: denique te ipsum
Concute, num qua tibi vitiorum inseverit olim 35
Natura aut etiam consuetudo mala : namque
N eglectis urenda filix innascitur agris.
Illuc praevertamur ε amatorem quod amicae
Turpia decipiunt caecum vitia, aut etiam ipsa haec

26. Acutum. Put for acuta—27. Epidaurius. Either an ornamental
epithet, 01· else alludi-ng to the circumstance of the serpent being sacred to
Aesculapius, who had a celebrated temple at Epidaurus in Argolis. The
ancients always ascribed a. very picrcing sight to serpents, particularly to
their fabled dragon. Hence the etymology of draco (δράκων) from δέρκω
(ἔδρακον, δράκων).

29-36. 29. Irae-nudior est paulo. “ A friend of thino is a little
too quick-tempered.'' The poet herc begins to insist on the duty we owe
our friends, of pardoning their little sailingS, especially if they be possessed
of talents and moral worth—Minus aptus acatis naribus, &c- ⁸¹ He
is too hemely a person for the nice perceptions of gentility which these
individuals possess.’' As regards the phrase acutis naribus, it may be
remarked, that it stands in direct opposition to obesis naribus. The
former, taken in a more literal sense than in the present passage, denotes
e. natural quiekness and sharpness of the senses; the latter, the reverse.
—30. Riderz' possit, eo quod, διο. “ He is liable to be laughed at,
because his hair is cut in too clowuish a manner, his toga drags on the
ground, and his loose shoe hardly keeps on his foot.”—3l. Rmticius
tonso. More literally, ‘⁶ To him shorn in too clownish a manner.''
Understand illi.—Male. This adverb qualifies haeret, not lamus—32.
At est bonus, &c. “ But he is a worthy man ς so much so, indeed, that
a worthier one does not live.’' The idea intended to be conveyed by the
whole passage is as follows : But. what of all this ? He is a man of worth,
he is thy friend, he has distinguished talents, and therefore thou shouldst
bear with his failings.-33. Inyenium ἐπι-96ης inculto, διο. “ Talents of
a high order lie concealed bencath this unpolished exterior.''-—34. Deni-
que te ipsum concute. “ In fine, examine thine own breast carefull‘y 3 ”
i. e. be not- a censor towards others, until thou hast been one to thyself.-—
36. IVamque neyleetis urenda, &c. “ For the fern, fit only to be immed,
is produced in neglected fields.’' The idea intended to be conveyed is this:
As neglected fieids must be cleared by fire of the fem which has overrun
them, so must those vices be cradicated from the breast, which either nature
or evil habits have produced.

38-40. 38. Illac praevertamur .· amatorem, &c- The tmnsition
