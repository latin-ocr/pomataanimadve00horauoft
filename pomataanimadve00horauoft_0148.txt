108 Q. HORATII FLACCI

CA RMEN XIII.
IN ARBOREM‚

CUJUS CASU PAENE OPPRESSUS FUERAT.

ILLE et nefasto te posuit die,
Quicunque primum, et sacrilega manu
Produxst, arbos, in nepotum
Perniciem‚ opprobriumque pagi.

<xv

Illum et parentis crediderim sui
Fregisse cervicem, et penetralia
Sparsisse nocturno cruore
Hospitis3 ille venena Colcha,

Et quidquid usquam concipitur nefas,
Tractavit, agro qui statuit meo 10
Te triste lignum, te caducum
In domini caput immerentis.

Om: XIII.—The poet, having narrowly escaped destruction from the
falling of a trec, indulges in strong and angry invectives against both the
tree and the individual who planted and reared it. The subject naturally
Ieads to serious reflectious, and the bard sings of the world of spirits, to
which he had been almost a visitant.

1—11. l. Ille et nefasto, διο. “ Ο tree, whoever first planted thee,
planted thee on an unlueky day, and with a sacrilegious hand reared thee
for the ruin of posterity, and the disgrace of my grounds.'' With qui-
cunque primum understand posuit te. Bentley reads, Illum o for Ille
et, and places a semicolon after payi in the fourth line. The passage,
as altered by him, will theu be translated as follows: “ For my part, l
believe that he, whoever first planted thee,'' &c.; and then in the fifth
line, ‘⁴ I say, Ι believe that he both made away with the life os his
parent.’' &C.—Nesaslo die. Compare note on Ode 11. iii. 6.—5. Cre-
diderim. “ For my part, I believe.'' The perfect subjunctive i's here used
with the force of a present, to express a softencd assertion.—6. Ec pene*
tralia‚'' διε. “ And spriukled the inmost parts of his dwelling with the
blood of'a guest slain in the night-season.” To violate the ties of hospi'-
tality was ever deemed one of the greatest of crimes—8. Ille venena
Colcha, &a “ He was wont to handle Colchian poiseus, and to perpe-
trate whatever wickedness is anywhere conceived,” &c.‚ i. e. all imaginable
wickedness. The zeugma in tractavit (which is here the aorist) is worthy
of notice.— Venena Colcha. The nume and skill of Medea gave celebrity,
among the poeta to thc'poisons of Colchis.—ll. Triste lignum. “ Un-
lucky tree.’' Liynum marks contempt.—Caducum ,- equivalent here to
cadentem, or casurum.
