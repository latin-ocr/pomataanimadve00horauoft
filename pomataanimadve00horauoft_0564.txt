522 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Tentantem majora, fere praesentibus aequum.
Contra, quem duplici panno patientia velat, 25
Mirabor, vitae via si conversa decebit.
Alter purpureum non exspectabit amictum,
Quidlibet indutus celeberrima per loca vadet,
Personamque feret non inconcinnus utramque :
Alter Mileti textam 03110 pejus et angui 30
Vitabit chlamydem 3 morietur frigore, si non
Retuleris pannum: refer, et sine vivat ineptus.

Res gerere et captos ostendere civibus hostes

ridiculed the singularities which were affected by other philosophers,

particularly the stately gravity of Plato, and the rigid abstinence of

Diogenes—24. Tentantem majora, fere praesentibus aequum. ‘⁴ As-
piring to greater‘thingss yet in his general conduct equal to the pre-
sent ;⁷’ i. e. losing no opportunity to better his fortune, but still easy 111
his present situation.—25. Contra, quem duplici pauno, &c. ‘⁶ On the
other hand, I shall be much surprised, if an opposite mode of life should
prove becoming to him whom obstinacy clothes with 3 thick coarse mau-
tle ;'’ literally, ‘⁴ with a double piece of eloth 3’' i. e. with a mantle as
thick as two ; a eoarse heavy gown ; in opposition to the purpureus
amictus mentioned immediately after. The allusion is here to Diogenes.

‘27—32. 27.Alter; alluding to Aristippus.—Non eoespectahit. “Will
not wait for.⁷'-—*28. Celeberrima per loca. ‘⁶ Through the most fre-
quented plaeeS.”—‘29. Pei-sonumque seret uon inconcinnus utramque.
‘⁶ And will support either character without the least admixture of awk-
wardness ;’' i. e. will aequit himself equally well, whether he appears
in a fine or a coarse garment, in 3 costly or a mean one—30. Alter
Mileti temtum, διο. “ The other will shun a cloak wrought at Miletus,
as something more dreadful than a rabit] dog or 3 51131103* Miletus, an
Ionian city, on the western coast of Asia Minor, was famed for the
excellence of its woollen manufactures.—3l. Morietur friqore, sa· uon
retuleris pannum. “ He will die with cold, if one does not restore him
his coarse cloak ;” i. e. he will rather perish with cold, than appear in
any other but his coarse cloak. Compare the story related by the
scholiast: “ Aiunt Aristippum, invitato Dio-yeme ad balneas, dedisse
operam, ut omues prius eyrederentur, ipsiusque pallium induisse illique
purpureum reliquisse, quod Dioyenes cum induere noluisset, suum
repetiit: lunc Aristippus increpuit Cynicum, famae servientem, qui
algere mallet quam conspici iu veste purpurea.''—3·2. Refer, et sine
vivat ineptus. “ Restore it, and let the fool live.’'

33-36, 33. Res perere et captos ostendere civibus hostes, &a “ To
perform exploits, and to show the citizens their foes led captive, reaches
the throne of J ove, and aspires to celestial honours : '' i. e. is mounting
up to the throne of Jupiter, and treading the paths of immortality.
The expression captos ostendere civibus hostes alludes to the solemnity
of a Roman triumph. Horace continues his argument, to prove that an
active life, the life of a man who aims at acquiring the favour of the
great, is preferable to the indolent h'fe of those who renounce all com-
