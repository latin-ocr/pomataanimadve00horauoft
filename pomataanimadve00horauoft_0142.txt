102 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Tu semper urgues flebilibus modis
Mysten ademtam ; nee tibi Vespero 10
Surgente decedunt amores,
N ec rapidum fugiente Solem.

At non ter aevo functus amabilem

Ploravit 01111165 Antilochum senex
Annos; nee impubem parentes 15

Troilon, aut Phrygiae sorores

F leveie semper. Desine mollium
Tandem querelarum3 et potius nova
Cantemus Augusti tropaea
Caesaris, et rigidum Niphaten 3 20

9—10. 9. Tu semper πηρασε, ἃς. “And §et thou art ever in
mournful strains pressing close upon the footsteps of thy M> stes, tom from
thee by the hand of death. ’' Urques is 11616 used as a more emphatic
and implessive teim than the common poosequerzs—10.Neo tibi ves—
pe ew, &c. “Nor do thy affectionate 50110115 cease when Vesper rises,
nor when he flees from befme the rapidly ascending sun. '⁷ The phrase
Vespero surgente mmks the eveuing 11611οά, when Vesper (the planet
Venus) appears to the east of the sun, and imparts its rnild radiance after
that luminary has set. On the other hand, the expression fugiente solem

means to designate the evening and morning, and to convey the idea that
the sorrows of Valgius admit of no cessation or repose‚ but continue unre«
mitted throughout the night as well as day. The planet Venus, when it
goes before the sun, is called, in strictness, Lucifer, or the morning-stam
but when it follows the sun, it is termed Hesperus or Vesper, and by us
the evening-star.

13-23. 1-3. Ter aevo functus seneoe. “ The aged warrior who
lived three generations;'' alluding to Nestor. Homer makes Nestor to
have passed through two generations, and to be ruling, at the time of
the Trojan war, among a third.—l4. Antilochum. Antilochus, son of
Nestor, was slain in defenee of his father, by Memnon. (Hom. Od. iv.
188.)-16. Tro‘ilon. Troilus, son of Priam, was slain by Achilles,
(Virg. Aen. i. 474). Phrygiae ,· put for Trqjanae—I7. Desine mol-
lium, 810. “ Cease then those unmanly complaints.” Prose Latinity would
require, in the place of this Graecism‚ the ablative querelis or the infinitive
queri--18. Nova Auyusti tropaea ; alluding to the successful opera-
tions of Augustus with the Armenians and Parthians, and to the repulse
of the Geloni, who had crossed the Danube and committed ravages in the
Roman multones—20. Riyidum Niphaten. ‘⁸ The iae-elad Niphates.'’
The ancient geographers gave the name of Niphates to 3. range of moun-
tains in Armenia, forming part of the great chain of Taurus, and inng
to the south-east of the Arsissa Palus or Lake Van. Their summits are
covered with snow throughout the whole year ; and to this circumstance
