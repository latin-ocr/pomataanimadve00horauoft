‘263 Q. HonATn FLACC1

Volente Circe, membra ; tunc mens et sonus
Relapsus, atque notus in vultus honor.

Dedi satis superque poenarum tibi,

Amata nautis multum et institoribus. 20
Fugit juventas, et verecundus color

Reliquit ossa pelle amicta lurida 3

Tuis capillus albus est odoribus,

Nullum a labore me reclinat otium.

Urguet diem nox, et dies noctem, neque est 25
Levare tenta spiritu praecordia.

Ergo negatum vincor ut credam miser,

Sabella pectus increpare carmina,

Caputque Marsa dissilire naenia.

Quid amplius vis? Ο mare! O terra! ardeo, 30
Quantum neque atro delibutus Hercules

Nessi cruore, nec Sicana fervida

Furens in Aetna flamma. Tu, donec cinis
Injuriosis aridus ventis ferar,

Cales venenis officina Colchicis. 35
Quae finis? aut quod me manet stipendium?

sonus, &c. “ Then reason and speech glided back, and their former
expression was gradually restored to their looks.⁷' The term relapsus
(the zeugma in which must be noted) beautifully describes, as it were

superque, &c. “ Enough and more than enough have I been tormented
by thee.’'—·2·2. Reliquit ossa pelle amicta lurida. ‘⁶ Has left behind
only bones covered over with a livid skin;'' i. e. has left me a mere
skeleton.—23. Tuis capillus albus, διο. “ My hair is become white by
the force of thy magio herbsl' The poet ascribes this to the effect proe
duced on his mind and feelings by tue incantatione of the sorceress, and not,
as Gessner suppose3‚ to any unguent actually applied by her to his locks.
25-41. 25. Est. ‘⁴ Is it allowed me3 ’¹ an imitation of the Greek
usage, by which ἐστί, est, is put for ἔξεστι, licea—26. Levare tenta, δια.
“ To relieve by respiration my distended lungs.'’—27. Neyatum.
‘⁴ What Ι once denied.’' Understand α rna—28. Sabella peetus incre-
pare carmina, διο. “ That Sabellian incantations disturb the breast, ,
and that the head splits asunder by a Marsian song.'' The poet here
very pleasantly applies to human beings what was thought, in the
popular belief, to happen merely to snakes. The Sabellians and Marsi
were famed for their skill in magio. By the former are here meant
the Sabines generally. Consult note on Ode 111. vi. 38.—33. Tu. donec ⁷
cinis, &c. “ Α living laboratory‚ thou glowest against me with the
magio drugs of Colchis, until Ι, become a dry cinder, shall be borne
