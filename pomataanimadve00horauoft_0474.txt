432 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Convivam : Nemon’ oleum fert ocius? ecquis

Audit? 011111 magno blateras clamore, fugisque. 35
Mulvius et scurrae tibi non referenda precati

Discedunt. Etenim, fateor mc, dixerit ille,
- Duci ventre levem 3 nasum nidore supinor ,-

Imbecillus, iners 3 si quid viS, adde, popina.

Tu, quum sis quod ege, et fortassis nequior, ultro 40
Insectere velut melior‘.2 verbisque decoris

Obvolvas vitium 2 Quid, si me stultior ipso

Quingentis emto drachmis deprenderis ἲ Aufer

Me vultu terrere ; manum stomachumque teneto,

Dum, quae Crispini docuit me janitor, edo. 45

Te conjux aliena capit, meretricula Davum :
Peccat uter nostrum cruce dignius? Acris ubi me

or three o’clock after noon iu summer, and the tenth hour in winter.
Maecenas, however, being entrusted, as minister, with the administration
of a. wide empne, could not ohserve so seasonable an hour as others.—
34. Oleum. The 011 15 11010 wanted for the lamp which is to guide his
footsteps as he proceeds to the residence of his patron, and also when
returning from the same—36. Mulvius et scm-rae. Horace would seem
stom this to have had parasites of his own, as well as the great. In 3
city like Rome, which might be called a world in itself, this could not be
well otherwise.—-36. Tibi uon referenda precati. “After having uttered

secret imprecations against thee.'' The expression tibi non referenda is “

equivalent here to tibi non audienda.

37-45, 37. Etenim, fatem- me, dixerit ille, &c. Mulvius here
utters a part of the abuse which has just been alluded to. It must
be supposed, however, to be spoken asida—Dixerit ille. “ Mulvius may
say.''—38. Duci ventre levem. ‘⁶ That I am easily led away by my
stomach ;” 10 play the part of a parasite and buffoon.-Nasum nidore
supinor. “ I raise my 11050 31 3 savoury smell.” A Graecism, for
nasus mihi supinatum—39. Si quid vis. “ If thou pleasest.'⁷—-40. Ultro.
‘⁶ Unprovoked by me.'’—4l. Ver—bisque decoris obvolvas vitium Ρ “ And
wilt thou eloak thy vices beneath specious names ?”-42. Qnid‚si me
stultior ipso, &e. Davus now speaks in his own person. “ What, if
thou art found to be a greater fool even than myself, who was purchased
for five hundred drachmas Ρ ” i.e. even than myself, a poor cheap slave.

. . ..η ,-...-Qffl-h;ssae-u.«Q-nnffld

Five hundred drachmas was a low price for a slave.-43. Aufer me vultu . ’ἶ

terrere, &c. Horace, unable to bear patiently the sarcasms of Davus,
especially the one last uttered, assumes 311 angry look, and raises his

hand in a threatening manner; and hence the slave observes, “Away ‘⁴

with trying to terrify me by that look 3 restrain thy hand and thy' anger.’'

—45. Crispini janitor. In order that the sage precepts of Crispinus ¹

may be set forth in all their djgnity and value, the very portel· at his

door 15 11010 laughably supposed to have eagerly imbibed them, and then v

doled them out to Davus and other equally eager expectants.
