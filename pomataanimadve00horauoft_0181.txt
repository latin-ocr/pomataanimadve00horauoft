Ome V.—The ode opens with a complimentary allusion to the power of
Augustus, and to his having wrestcd the Roman standards from the hands
of the Parthians. The 'nard then dwells for a time upon thc disgraccful
defeat ofrCrassus‚ after which the noble example of Regulus is introduced,
and a tacit comparison is then made, during the rcst of the picce, between
the high-toned principles of the virtuous Roman and the strict discipline of
Augustus.

1-3. l. Coelo tonantem, διο. “KVc believe from his thundering
that Jove reigns in the skics.” Compare Lucan, iii. 319, seqq.—2.
Praesens divus, διο. Having stated the common grounds on which the
belief of Jupiter's divinity is founded, the poet now proceeds, in accordance
with the- flattery of the age, to name Augustus as a “ deity upon earth,''
(praesens divus‚) assigning‚ as ajrgpL of this, his triumph over t'ne
nations of the farthest east and west, especially liisssaffing wrested from
the Parthians, by the mere terror of his name, the standards so disgrace-
fully lost by the Roman Crassus—3. Adjectis Britannis, &c. “ The
Britons and the formidable Parthians being added to his sway.'’ Accord-
ing to Strabo, some of the princes of Bxitain sent embassies and presents ω
Augustus, and placed a large portion of the island under his control. lt
was not. however, reduced to a Roman province until the time of Claudius.
What Horace adds respecting the Parthians is adorned with the exaggera-

· tion of poetry. This nation was not, in fact, added by Augustus to the
empire of Rome; they only surrendered, through dread of the Roman
power, the standards taken from Crassus.

5—12. 5. Milesne Crassi, ἃς. “ Has the soldier of Crassus lived,a
degraded husband, with a barbarian spouse?’' An allusion to the soldiers
of Crassus made captives by the Parthians, and who, to save theiQSQ)-.- ⁷
had intermarried with females of that nation. Hence the {Ten-filia? force of ⁷

Qwhich is well explained by one of the scholiasts ι “ uaeores a vio· .“
toribus acceperant, ut zLitam mererentur.'' To constitute a lawful
marriage among the Romans, lt was required that both the contracting
parties be citizens and free. There was no legitiniate marriage between
slaves; nor was a Roman⁴*cifize11 permittcd to marry a slave, a barbarian,
orta foreigner enerally. Such a connexion was called-cot-tnabfiam„ not
‘manutentum—7. Pro Curia, inversique mores! “'Ah3 senate of

’ ’ my country, and degenerate principles of the day l '’ The poet mourns
over the want of spirit on the part of the senate, in allowing the disgraceful
desem of Crassus to remainsqnlong unavenged, and over the stain fixed
on the martial character of Rome by this connexion of her captive soldiery
with their barbarian conqtierors, Such a view of the subject carries with
lt a tacit but flatteiing eulogium on thc successful operatione of AugustuS.
