ΟΝ ΒΟΜΑΝ SATIRE. 28 l

exhibited to the public, The plays of Terence and his contemporaries repre
seuted Greek, not Roman, manners ; and toward the close of the Republic‚
and commencement of the Empire, the placo of the regular comcdy was
usurped by mimes or pantomimos. All the materials, then, which in other
countries have been seized by writers for the stage, were exclusively at the
disposal and command of the satirist. In the age of Louis XIV. Boilcau
would scarcely have ventured to draw a full-length portmit of a misanthrope
or a hypocrite: but Horace encountcred no Monere, on whose department
he might dread to encroaeh 3 and, accordingly, his Satires represent almost
every diversity of folly incident to human nature. Sometimes, too, ho
bestows on his Satires, at least to a certain extent, a. dramatie sorm; and
thus avails himself of the advantages which the drama supplies. By intro-
ducing various characters discoursing in their own style, and expressing
their own peculiar sentimum, he obtained a wider range than if everything
had seemed to flow from the pen of the author. How could he have
displayed the follies and foibles of the age so well, asin the person of a
slave perfectly acquainted with his mastcr's private life Ρ how could he have
exhibioed the extravagance of a philosophie sect so justly, as from the
mouth of the pretended philosopher, newly converted to Stoicism Ρ or how
could he have described the banquet of Nasidienus with such truth, as from
the lips of a guest who had been present at the entertainment Ρ

Horace had also at his uncontested disposal all those materials which,
in modern times, have contributed to tho formation of the novel or
romance. Nothing resembling that attractive species of composition
appeared at Rome before the time of Petronius Arbiter in the reign of
Nero. Hence, those comic occurrences in the street, at the theatre, or
entertainrnents—the humours of taverns—the adventures of a campaign or
journey¹ which have supplied a Le Sage and a Fielding with such varied
exhibitions of human life and manners, were all reserved untouched for the
Satiric Musa to combine, exaggerate, and diversify. The chief taient of
Horace's patrons, Augustus and Maecenas, lay in a true discernmcnt of the
tempere and abilities of mankind ; and Horace himself was distinguished by
his quick perception of character, and his equal acquaintance with books
and men. These qualifications and habits, and the advantages derived
from them, will be found apparent in almost every Satire. (Dunlop's
