562 Q. HORATII FLAccl

Fabellam surdo. Nam quae pervincere voces 200
Evaluere sonum, referunt que'in nostra theatra?
Garganum mugire putes nemus, aut mare Tuscum:
Tanto cum strepitu ludi spectantur, et artes,
Divitiaeque peregrinae 3 quibus oblitus actor
Quum stetit in scena, concurrit dextera laevae. 205
Dixit adhuc aliquid ‚P—Nss sane—Quid placet erqo ,9-
Lana Tarentino violas imitata veneno.

Ac ne forte putes, me, quae facere ipse recusem,
Quum recte tractent alii, laudare maligne ;

“While he would think the writers told their story to a deaf ass 3⁹¹
i. e. while, as for the poets, he would think them employed to about as
much purpose as if they were telling their story to a deaf ass.—·200.
Nam quae pervincere voces evaluere sonum, διο. “ For what strength of
lungs is able to surmount the din with which our theatres resound ?'‘
i. e. for what actor can make himself heard amid the uproar of our
theatres Ρ-ΞΟΞΞ, Garganum mugire putes nemus, &c. The chain of
Mount Gargarius was covered with forests, and exposed to the action
of violent winds. Hence the roal-ing of the blast amid its woods
forms no unapt comparison on the present occasion. Consult note ou
Ode 11. ix. 7.—‘203. Et artes, divitiaeque peregrinae. “ And the works of
art, and the riches of foreign lands.” Artes here refers to the statues,
vases, and other things of the kind, that were displayed in the theatrical
pageants which the poet condemns—204. Quibus ›blitus actor quum
stetit in scena, &c. “ As soon as the actor makes his appearance on the
stage, profusely covered with which, the right hand runs to meet the
left ;” i. e. applause is given. The allusion in quibus, that is in divitiae,
is to purple, precious stones, eostly apparel, &c.*207. Lana Tarentino
violas imitata veneno. ‘⁶ The wool of his robe, which imitates the hues
of the violet by the aid of Tarentine dye 3³³ i. e. his robe dyed with the
purple of Tarentum, and not inferior in hue to the violet. Veneno is here
taken in the same sense that φάρμακον sometimes is in the Greek.
208—-214 208. Ac ne forte puteS, me, quae fitcere ipse recusem, διο.
Here, observes Hurd, the poet should naturally have concluded his
defence of the dramatic writers3 having alleged every thing in their
favour, that could be urged plausibly, from the state ff the Roman
stage—the genius [ff the peopZe—aud the several prevailz'ng practices of
ill toste, which had brought them into disrepute with the best judges.
But finding himself obliged, in the course of this vindication of the
modern stage-poets, to censure, as sharply as their very enemies, the
vices and defects of their poetry3 and fearing lest this severity on
a sort of writing to which he himself had never pretended, *might be
misinterpreted as the effect of envy only, and a malignant disposition
towards the art itself, under cover of pleading for its professors, he
therefore frankly avows (from line ‘208 to 214) his preference of the ,
dramatic- to every other species of poetry3 declar-ing the sovereignty of
its pathos over the affections, and the magio of its illusive scenery on
the imag-iwatwn, to be the highest argument of poetic excellence, the
