244 Q. EORATH FLAcor

Quae sidera excantata voce Thessala 45
Lunamque coelo deripit.
Hic irresectum saeva dente livido
Canidia rodens pollicem
Quid dixit? aut quid tacuit? ‘⁶ Ο rebus meis
Non infideles arbitrae, 50
Nox et Diana, quae silentium regis,
Arcana quum fiunt saera,
Nunc, nuno adeste: nunc in hostiles domos
Iram atque numen vertite.
Formidolosae dum latent silvis ferae, 55
Dulci sopore languidae,
Senem, quod omnes rideant, adulterum

N ardo perunctum, quale non perfectius
Meae laborarint manus.— 60
Quid accidit? cur dira barbarae minus
Venena Medeae valent,

manner of sorceresses, invokes Night and Hecate, who were supposed to
preside over magio rites. Quae silentium reyis ‚· an allusion to Diana's
shining during the silence of the night, the seasou best adapted for the
ceremonias of magia—53. N unc, nunc adeste, &a Mitscherh'ch makes
this an¹ imitation of an old form of prayer, and equivalent to ‘⁸ Mihi pro-
pitiae sitis, ira vestra in hostes abliyata.” The scholiast is wrong in
supposing the meaning of the latter part to be in Varum iram vestram
effundite.—54. Numen. “ Power.''—57. Senem. quod omnes rideant,
&c. “ May the dogs of the Subura drive him hither with their barking‚
that all may laugh at his expense, the aged profligate, anointed with an
essence more powerful than any which my hands have hitherto pre-
pared.'’—Senem adulterum. The allusion is to Varus, and the manner
in which he is here indicated by Canidia, tends indirectly to cast ridicule
upon herself for seeking to reclaim such an admirer.—58. Suburanae
canes. The Subura was the most profligate quarter of Rome, and the
rambles of Varus, therefore, in this part of the capital, were anything
>else but creditable.—59. Nardo perunctum. The allusion here is an
