Nam male re gesta quum vellem mittere operto

Me capite in flumen, dexter stetit, et, Cave faxis

Te quidquam indignum : pudor, inquit, te malus angit,
Insanos qui inter vereare insanus haberi. 40
Primum nam inquiram, quid sit furere ε hoc si erit in te
Solo, nil verbi, pereas quin fortiter, addam.

Quem mala stultitia, et quemcunque inscitia veri

Caecum agit, insanum Chrysippi porticus et grex

Autumat. Haec populos, haec magnos formula regeS, 45
Excepto sapiente, tenet. Nunc accipe, quare

Desipiant omnes aeque ac tu, qui tibi nomen

Insano posuere. Velut silvis, ubi passim

Palantes error certo de tramite pellit,

Ille sinistrorsum, hie dextrorsum abit3 unus utrisque 50
Error, sed variis illudit partibus 3 hoc te

Crede modo insanum; nihilo sapientior ille,

Qui te deridet, caudam trahat. Est genus unum

stultitiae nihilum metuenda timentis, ut ignes,

inscription still remaining on one of the arches testifies. The modern
name is Ponte di quattro Capi, ‘⁴ the bridge of the four heads‚'' from a
four-faeed statue of ,J anus erected near it.-Non tristem. “ With my
mind at ease.” No longer plunged in melancholy.

37—46. 37. Operto capite. Among the ancients‚ all who had de-
voted themselves to death in any way, or on any account, previously
covered the head. Damasippus intended to destroy himself, on the
occasion alluded to, in consequence of the ruin of his private affairs.-
38. Deoeter stetit. “ He stood on a sudden by my side, like a guardian
genius.”--Cave. The final vowel of this word is short, the form here
employed being deduced from the old cavo, -ἕνε, the primitive and stern-
oonjugation of caveo-ere.-39. Pudor malus. “ A false shame.”-
43. Mala stultitia. “ Vicious folly.”—44. Chrysippi porticus et yreoe.
“ The portico, and the school of Chrysippus.” The ignorant Stoic here
confounds the disciple with the master, and, instead of referring to Zeno,
the actual founder of the Stoic sect, names Chrysippus as such—45.
Autumat. “ Deem.''—Haec formula. “ This definition.”—46. Tenet.
In the sense of complectitur.

48—60. 48. Velut silvis, ubi passim, διο. The train of ideas is as
follows : As is accustomed to happen in wood5‚ where those who wander
about generally all go wrong : this one mistakes his way to the lest, that
one to the right 3 each errs, but in a different way from the other: in
this same manner (hoc modo), believe thyself to be insane3 while he who
laughs at thee is in no respect whatever a wiser man than thou art, and
will be himself laughed at by others as not in possession of his sensea—
53. caudam trahat. A metaphor, taken, as the scholiast informs us,
