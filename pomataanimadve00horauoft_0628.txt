584 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Utar, et ex modico, quantum res poscet, acervo 19⁰
Tollam 3 nec metuam, quid de me judicet heres,

Pauperies immunda procul procul absit : ego, utrum
Nave ferar magna an parva, ferar unus et idem. 200
Non agimur tumidis velis aquilone secundo ς
N on tamen adversis aetatem ducimus austris3

Extremi primorum, extremis usque priores.
Non es avarus: abi. Quid? cetera jam simul isto 205
Cum vitio fugere ’.ἶ caret tibi pectus inani
Ambitione ’.Β caret mortis formidine et ira 2
