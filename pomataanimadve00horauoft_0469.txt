since mortal souls have been allotted to all things that exist upon the
earth. The city mouse,haw'ng seen more of the world than his country
acquaintance, appears to great advantage by the side os the latter, and
deals out the doctrines of Epicurus, respecting the non-existence of a
future state, with all the gravity of a philosopher. A mouse turned
sceptic is, indeed, an odd sight !-—95. Quo, bone, circa. Α tmesis for
