214 Q. HORATII FLACCI

OARMEN IX.
AD LOLLIUM.

NE forte credas interitura, quae,
Longe sonantem natus ad Aufidum,
Non ante vulgatas per artes
Verba loquor socianda chordis.

whom they celebrate descende to after-ages with the numbers of the bard,
while, if a poet be wanting, the bravest of heroes slecps forgotten in the
tomb. Thy praises then, Lollius, shall be my theme, and thy numerous
virtues shall live in the immortality of verse.

M. Lollius Palicanus, to whom this ode is addressed, enjoyed for 3 long
time a very high reputation. Augustus gave him A. U. C. 728, the govern-
ment of Galatia, with the title of propraetor. He acquitted himself so
well iu this office, that the emperor, in order to reeompense his services,
named him consul, in 732, with L. Aemilius Lepidus. In this year the
present ode was written, and thus far nothing had occurred to tarnish his
famo. Being seut, in 737, to engage the Germws, who had made 311
irruption into Gaul, he had the misfortune, after some successes, to expe·
rience a defeat, known in history by the name of Lolliano Clades, and in
which he lost the eagle of the fifth legion. It appears, however, that he
was able to repair this disaster, and regain the confidence of Augustus ς for
this monarch chose him, about the year 751, to accompany lris grandson
Caius Caesar into the East, as a kind of director of his youth ( ‘⁴ velutz
moderator ,ᾇῑιυεηίαεῖ7 Vell. Pat. ii. 102). It was in this mission to
the East, seven or eight years after the death of our poet, that be became
guilty of the greatest depredations, and formed secret plots. which were
disclosed to Caius Caesar by the king of the Parthians. Lollius died sud-
denly a few days after this, leaving behind him an odious memory.
Whether his end was voluntary or otherwise, Velleius Paterculus declares
himself unable to decide—We must not confound this individual with the
Lollius to whom the second and eighteenth epistles of the first book are
inscribed ; a mistake into which Dacier has fallen, and which he endeavours
to support by very feeble arguments. Sanadon has clearly shown that
these two epistles are evidently addressed to a very young man, the
father, probably, of Lollia Paulina, whom Caligula took away from O.
Memmius, 111 order to espouse her himself, and whom he repudiated soon
after. We have in Pliny (Nat. Hist. ix, 35) a curious passage re-
specting the enormous richcs which this Lollia had inherited from her
grandfather.
