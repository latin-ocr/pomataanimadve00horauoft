METRES OF HoRACE. xxxiii

Hence, lines thus composed of independent metros are called
ἂσυναρτήτοι or inconnexi, on account of this mcdial license. Archi-
lochus, according to Hephaestion, was the first who employed them.
(Bentley, ad Epod. ii.) Many editions, however, prefer the simplcr
though less correct division into distinct measures: as,

Scribere Ι υένεῐοῆἰῖῦε
ἈνηῦΙνέρένΗσιῖῖειῖνη Ι yriivi.

22. humen-Damam.

This measure occurs in the 2d, 4th‚ and other even lines of the 13th
Epode of Horace, as it is arranged in this edition. The first part of
the verse is an Iambic Dimeter‚ (No. 7‚) the latter part is a Dactylic
Tn'meter catalectic (No. 3). It is, therefore, directly the reverse of the
preceding.

ὃσοᾶιεῖῦΙηῦιη ἀὲ Ι die? .- Ι άιῖηιᾳιιὲ υἴΙνέηι ῃέηῆἱᾶ.

The license mentioned in tho preceding measure takes place also in
this; as,

Epod. xiii. line 8. Redueet in sedem vice. Nunc, &c.
— 10. Levare diris pectora sollicitudinibus.
— 14. Findunt Scamandri flumina-2, lubricus, διο.

These lines are also, like those mentioned in the preceding section,
called ἆσυναρτήτοι or inconnexi. Many editions prefer the following
arinngemeut, which has simplicity in its favour, but not sirict aceu-
ται-γε

ΟοσᾶΙεῖὄῇηέηι (se Ι di} .-
DffmquE υῐῐνέηἰ finale.
