EPISTOLARUM Lm. 1. ll. 499

Neptunum procul e terra spectare furentem. - 10
Sed neque qui Capua Romam petit, imbre lutoque ‘
Adspersus, volet in caupona vivere, nec qui
Frigus collegit, furnos et balnea laudat,
Ut fortunatam plene praestantia vitam.
Nec, si te validus jactaverit Auster in alto, 15
Idcirco navem trans Aegaeum marc vendas.

Incolumi Rhodos et Mitylene pulchra facit, quod
Paenula solstitio, campestre nivalibus auris,
Per brumam Tiberis, Sextili mense caminus.

the latter city. ——11. Sed neque qui Cc1p11a‚&c. The idea intended to
be conv ey ed, from this line to the close of the epistle, is as follow-:s But
whatex er city or region m· ιι have pleased thee, mx friend return now, 1
entreat thee, to Rome. For, as he ιιΙιο 3οιιιιιθι5 to the latter place
from Capua, does not feel inclined to pass the rest of his d: ιι s in an inn
by the way, because, ιι hen bespattcred with rain and mire, he has been
able to dry and cleaiise himself there; and as he who, wlien labouring
under the chill of a fev‚er has obtairied relies from 'the stote and the
warm- -bath‚ does not therei'ore regard these as sufficient to complete the
happiness <if lise ; so do thou linger no more in the places ιι hich at pre-
sent may delight thee, nor, if a tempest shall have tossed thee on the
deep, sell in consequence thy vessel, and revisit not for the time to come
thy native country and thy friends. Rhodes and the fair Mitylene are tao
him who visits them when in sound health precisely the same as other
things, which, though good in themselves, prove, if not used at the pro-
per period, injurious rather than beneficial. Return, therefore, and, far
removed from them, praise foreign cities and countries from Rome.
Enjoy the good things which fortune now auspiciously offers‘, in order
that, wherever thou mayest be, thou mayest be able to say that thy life
has been passed happily. For if the cares of the mind are removed, not
by pleasing scenery, but by reason and reflection‚ they surely who run
beyond the sea change elimate only, not the mind. Yet such is human
nature, we are borne afar in ships and chariots, to seek for that which
lies at our very doors.

fortunatam plene, ἃς. “ As completely furnishing the means of a
happy life.''—-l7. Incolumi Rhodos et Mitylene, Sec. ‘⁶ Rhodes and fair
Mitylene are, to a man in good health, the same as a great coat at the
summer sohtice, a pair of dmwers alone in the snowy season.’' As
regards Mitylene, compare note on verse 1, “notaque Lesbos? The
paenula was a kind of great coat or wrapper worn above the tunic, used
chiefly on journeys and in the army. It was sometimes covered with a
rough pile or hair for the sake of warmth‚ at other times made of skins,
διο. By the campestre is properly meant a sort of linen coming, used
by those who exercised naked in the Campus Martius, that nothing inde-
cent might be seen. We have rendered the term ‘⁶ a pair of drawers,”
merely for the sake of making the general meaning more intelligible to
