616 Q. IIORATII FLACCI

Pes citus ; unde etiam Trilnetris accrescere jussit
Nomen iambeis, quum senos redderet ictus,

Primus ad extremum similis sibi. Non'ita pridem,
'sanlior ut paulo· graviorque veniret ad aures,
spondeos stabiles in jura paterna recepit
Commodus et patiens ; non ut de sede secunda
Cederet aut quarta socialiter ς hio et in Acci
Nobilibus Trimetris apparet rarus, et Enni.

In, scenam missus magno cum pondere verSUS‚ ‘260
Aut operae celeris nimium curaque carentis,

Satyric Drama, for, accurately speaking, the proper measure of the latter
was, as the grammarians teach, the iambic enlivened with the tribrach.
“ Gaudent trisyllaba pede et maxime tribraclze.'’ (Victor 2. c. met.
lamb.) Yet there was resemblance enough to consider this whole
affair of the metre under the same head—252. Unde etiam Trimetris
accrescere jussit, διο. “ Whenee also it ordered the name Trimeters to
be given to iambics, when it yielded six beats, from first to last like
itself.'' The meaning is, that though six beats were yielded, or in
other words, six iambi arranged in a verse, yet, owing to the rapidity of
the foot, these six only formed three metres, i. e. a trimeter iambic line„—
254. Primus ad extremum similis sibi,&c. The import of these words is,
that the feet originally employed were all iambi, forming what is called a
pure iambic line—255. Tui-clim· ut paulo graviorque, dcc. The spondee
was introduced to correct the swiftness of the iambic verse, and make it
more consistent with the dignity and gravity of tragic composition.
Compare page xxii. of this volume.—256. Spoizd'eos stabiles. Spondees
are here elegantly denominated stabiles, from the circumstance of their
not running on rapidly like the iambus, but moving along, by reason
of their greater heaviness, at a slow and steady pace.-—In jura patei-na.
“Into a participation of its hereditary rights :” ι’. e. the right, hitherto
exclusively its own, of appearing in iambic versification„ Compare
note on verse 254.—·257. Commodus et patiens. “ Obligingly and con-
tentedly.’'—-Non ut de sede secunda, &cn ‘¹ Not, however, so as to retire
, from the second or the fourth place, after the manner of friends to whom
¹ all things are in common.'' The iambus yields only the odd places to
'the spondee, the first, third, and fifth ς but preserves the second, fourth,
and sixth, for asem—258. Hie et in Acci nobilibus trimetris, &c. “ This·
'iambus, in the second and fourth places, rarely appears in the noble
trimeter-s of Accius and Ennius.'' Nobilibus trimetris is ironical.
Horace blames Accius and Ennius for not observing the strict rule re-
specting the position of the iambus in the even places of the trimeter,
and for making their verses, in consequence, hard and heavy, by the
presence of too many spondee3.—‘260. In scenam missus magno cum pon-
dere versus, &c. According to our poet, a verse sent upon the stage,
labouring beneath a heavy load of spondees, reflects discredit upon, its
author, and either shows that he has been too hasty, and has not 'given
himself time to fashion his poem, or else proves him to be ignorant of
the rules of his own art.
