520 Q. HOR ATII FLACCI

Disce, docendus adhuc quae censet amiculus 3 ut si

Caecus iter monstrare velit: tamen aspice, si quid

Et nos, quod cures proprium fecisse, loquamur. 5
Si te grata quies et primam somnus in horam

Delectat3 si te pulvis strepitusque rotarum,

Si laedit caupona ε Ferentinum ire jubebo.

Nam neque divitibus contingunt gaudia solis,

N ec vixit male, qui natus moriensque fefellit. 10

Si prodesse tuis pauloque benignius ipsum

Te tractare voles, accedes siccus ad unctum.

slippery road⁴ He shows, that an active life, the life of a man who
attempts to gain and preserve the favours of the great by honourable
means, is far more reputable than an idle life without emulation and am-
bition. He then assures him, that nothing can more probably ruin him
at court, than a mean and sordid design of amassing money by asking
favours.

1-5, 1. Scaeva. As this and the next epistle are written upon the
same subject, the copyists would seem to have joined them together.
Baxter and Gesner incline to the opinion that they were both written to
the same person. We do not find, however, as Gesner himself acknow-
ledges, that the house of Lollius ever took the cognomen of Scaeva,
which appears in the Junian and Cassian families only. It is probable,
that the individual here meant was the son of that Scaeva whose valour
is so highly spoken of by Caesar. (B. C. iii. 53.)-—Per te; equivalent to
tua ipsius prudentiae—Et scis, quo tandem pacto deceat majoribus uti.
“ And knowest well how to conduct thyself towards thy superiors ;'' i. e.
and art no way at a loss as to the manner of living with the grean—3.
Disce, docendus adhuc quae censet amiculus. “ Yet hear what are the
sentiments of thy old friend upon the subject, who himself still requires
to be taught.”— Ut εἰ caecus iter monstrare velit. ‘⁴ As if a blind guide
should wish to show thee the way.'' The poet here, in allusion to the
docendus adhuc which has gone before, styles himself caecus, a blind
guide.-5. Quod cures proprium fecisse. ‘⁴ Which thou mayest dcem
it worth thy while to make thine own.'' Proprium fecisse is here equi-
valent to in usum tuum convertisse.

6-11, 6. Primam somnus z'n horam. “ Sleep until the first hour ;''
i. e. until seven o’clock.—8. Caupona. “ The noise of the tavern.''—-
Ferentinum. A city of Etruria, south-east of the Lacus Vulsiniensis.
It was almost deserted in the days of Augustus—10. Να- visit mak,
qui natus moriensque fefellit. “ Nor has he lived ill, whO, at his birth
and death, has escaped the observation of the world ;'' i. e. nor has he
made an ill choice of existence, who has passed all his days in the bosom
of obscurity.—ll. Si prodesse tais pauloque ὂεηὶρηίαε, &c- ‘⁶ If, how-
ever, thou shalt feel disposed to be of service to thy ffiends‚ and to treat
thyself with a little more indulgence than ordinary, thou wilt go a poor
man to the rich ;'' i. e. if thou shalt want to be useful to thy friends,
and indulge thyself more freely in the pleasures of life, then make thy
court to the great.-l·2. Siccus, when the reference is to drinking, is
opposed to uvidus, but in the case of eating, to unctus. The term zenoti,
