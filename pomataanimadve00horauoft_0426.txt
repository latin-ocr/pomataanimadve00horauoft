384 Q. HoRATH FLACCI

Ut rupes, fluviosque in campo obstare queratur z 55
Alterum et huic varum et nihilo sapientius, ignes

Per medios fluviosque ruentis3 clamet amica,

Mater, honesta. soror, cum cognatis pater, uxor:

Hic fossa est inqens, liic rupes maxima, serva!

Non magis audierit, quam Fufius ebrius olim, <30
Quum Ilionam edormit, Catienis mille ducentis,

Mater, te appello, clamantibus. Huic ego vulgus

Errori similem cunctum insanire docebo.

Insanit veteres statuas Damasippus emendo :

from a custom among children, who tied a tail behind a person whom
they had a mind to laugh ata-56. Huic varum. “The opposite to
‘chisen-59. Serva. “ Take care.”—60. Non mayis audierit, quam
Fufius ebrius olim, διο. The idea of a person madly making his way
amid such dangers as those mentioned in the text, deas to all the
exclamations and wamings of his friends, naturally reminds Stertinius of
the laughable anecdota relative to the actor Fufius. In the play of
Pacuvius, entitled Iliona, Fufius had to support the character of this
princess 3 and in the scene where the shade of her son, who had been
murdered by Polymnestor, king of Thrace, appeared to her, and began
to address her in the words Mater, te appello, proceeding to relate what
had happened to him, and entreating the rites of bur-iai, the drunken
Fufius, who should have awakened and sprung from his couch at the
very first words, IVIater, te appello, slept away in good earnest ; while
Catienus, the performer, who acted the part of the shade, and the entire
audience aster him (Catienis mille ducentis), kept calling out the words
to no purpose, the intoxicated actor being too soundly asleep to hear
them. -

61-62. 61. Quum Ilionam edormit. “ When he sleeps through
the part of Iliona.”-—C'atienis mille ducentis. The audience joined in
the cry of Catienus to the sleeping performer 3 and hence they are
pleasantly styled so many Catienuses.——6 3. Huic eyo vulqus, διο. The
construction is as follows: Eyo docebo cumeum vulqus· insanire errorem
similem huic errori. “ I wffl now show that the common herd of man-
kind are all similme insane ;” i. e. resemble either one or the other of
the two instances which I have cited. The term vulgus is here pur-
posely employed, as keeping up the distinction between the wisc man of
the Stoics and the less-favoured portion of his fellow-creatures.

64—72. 64. Insanit veteres statuas, διο. Stertinius now proceeds
to prove his assei-tion, that the common herd of mankind are all mad.
The train of ideas is as follows .—Damasippus is mad in buying up old
statues: the creditor of Damasippus, who lends him the money where-
with to make these purchases, is also mad, for he knows very well it will
never be repaid ι usurers are mad in putting out money at interest with
worthless and unprincipled men, for, however eareful they may be in
taking written obligations for repayment, these Proteus-like rogues will
slip through their fingers : Finally, he is mad who lends money at such
an exorbitant rate of interest that it can never be paid by the debtor.-
