480 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Unus ut e multis populo spectante referret 60
Emtum mulus aprum. Crudi tumidique lavemur,

Quid deceat, quid non, obliti, Caerite cera

Digni, remigium vitiosum Ithacensis Ulixei,

Cui potior patria fuit interdicta voluptas.

Si, Mimnermus uti censet3 sine amore jocisque 65
Nil est jucundum: vivas in amore jocisque

Vive, vale3 si quid novisti rectius istis,
Candidus imperti 3 si non, his utere mecum.

picture, however, which the poet draws of him is a pleasing one, and
might very easily be made to apply to more modern times—60. Unus ut
e multis, &c. “To the intent that one mule out of many might bring
back, in the sight of the same populace, a honr purchased with money.
—61. Crudi tumidique lavemur. “ Let us bathe with our food undi-
gested, and a full-swoln stomacl1.'' Bathing so soon after a meai was
decidedly injurious; but the epicures of the day resorted to this expedient,
that they might hasten the natural digestion, and prepare themselves for
another entertainment.—G·2. Caerite cera digni. “ Deserving of being
enrolled among the Caerites.'’ The term cera has reference to the
Roman mode of writing on tablets covered with wax, and hence the
expression in the text, when more literally rendered, will mean, being
enrolled in the same registers, or on the same tablets, that contain the
names of the Caerites. According to the common account, the Caerites,
or inhabitants of Caere, having received the Vestal virgins an'd tutelary
gods of Rome when it was sacked by the Gauls, the Romans, out of
gratitude, gave them the privileges of citizens, with the exception of the
right of suffrage. What was to them, however, an honour, would prove
to a Roman citizen an actual degradation; and therefore, when any one
of the latter was guilty of any disgraceful or infamous conduct, and lost
in consequence his right of suffrage by the decree of the censors, he was
said to be enrolled among the Caerites. (In tabulas Caeritum referri.)—
63. Remigium vitiosum Ithacensis Ulia-ei. Supply sicuti.—64. Inter-
dicta voluptas. ‘⁶ F orbidden pleasure.’' Ulysses had warned his com-
panions not to touch the cups of Circe if they wished to revisit their
country. The advice proved fluitless.-—65. Mimnermus. A poet of
Colophon in Ionia, who flourished about 590 Β. C. He composed ele-
giae strains, and is regarded as the first that applied the alternate hexa-
meter and pentameter measures to such subjecta—67. Istis. ’ Referring

to the maxims which the poet has here laid down respecting the felicit!
that virtue alone can bestow.
