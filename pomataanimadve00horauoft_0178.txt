138 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Visam Britannos hospitibus feros,
Et laetum equino sanguine Concanum ;

Visam pharetratos Gelonos ' ’ 7351

Et Scythicum inviolatus amnem.

Vos Caesarem altum, militia simul
Fessas cohortes abdidit oppidis, ,1
F inire quaerentem labores,
Pierio recreatis antro : 40

Vos lene consilium et datis, et dato
Gaudetis-almae„ Scimus, ut impios
Titanas immanemque turmam
Fulmine sustulerit caduco,

Qui terram inertem, qui mare temperat 45
Ventosum ; et umbras regnaque tristia,
Divosque, mortalesque turbas
Imperio regit unus aequo.

Utcunque ,- put for quandocunque—30. Bosporum. consult note on
Ode 11. xiii. 14.-—3·2. Litoris Assyrii. The epithet Assyrii 'is here
equivalent to Syrii. The name Syria itself, which has been. transmitted
to us by the Greeks, is a corruption or abridgement of Assyria,' and was
first adopted by the Ionians who frequented these coasts after the Assyriam
of Nineveh had made this country a part of their empire. The allusion
in the text appears to be to the more inlan'd deserts, the Syriae Pal-
myrenae solitudines of Pliny, Hist. Nat. v. 24.—33. Britannos hos·
pitibusseros. Acron, in his scholia on this ode, informs us ‘that the
Britons were said to sacrifice straugers.—34. Concanum. The concaui
were a Cantabrian tribe in( Spain. As a proof of their ferocity the poet
mentions their drinking {iffffl‘cssd of horses intermixed with their liquor.—
35. Gelonos. Consult note on Ode 11. ix. 23.—36. Scythicum amnem.
The Tanais or Don.

38—64. 38. Fessus cohortes abdidit oppidis .- alluding to the mili· Ι

tary colonies planted by Augustus, at the close of the civil wars. Some
editions have reddidit, for abdidit, which m‘ll then refer merely to the
disbanding of his forces.—40. Pierio antro, a figurative allusion to the
eharms of literary leisure. Ρὶςῐιρτγιζ originally a part of Thrace, formed
subsequently the northern part of Macedonia, on the eastern side. It
was fabled to have been the first seat of the Muses—41. Vos lene
consilium, ἃς. “ You‚ ye benign deities, both inspire Caesar with peace-
ful counsels, and rejoice in having done so.’' A complimentary allusion
to the mild and liberal policy of Augustus, and his patronage of letters
and the arts.—Iu reading metrically, consilium et must be pronounced
consil-yet.-—44. Fulmine sustulerit caduco, “Swept away with his
descending thunderbolt.’' Some editions read corusco, “ gleaming,” for
caducae-50. Fidens brachiis. “Proudly trusting in their might.’'
