EPISTOLARFM Lm. 11. l. 545

Urit enim fulgore suo, qui praegravat artes
Infra se positas : extinctus amabitur idem.
Praesenti tibi maturos largimur honores, 15
J urandasque tuum per numen ponimus aras,
Nil oriturum alias, nil ortum tale fatentes.
Sed tuus hic populus sapiens et justus in uuo,
Te nostris ducibus, te Graiis anteferendo,
Cetera nequaquam simili ratione modoque *20
Aestimat, et nisi quae terris semota suisque
Temporibus defuncta videt, fastidit et odit :
Sic fautor veterum, ut tabulas peccare vetantes,
Quas bis quinque viri sanxerunt, foedera regum

i. e. the labours imposcd on him by fate—12. Comperit invidiam
supremo fine domari. ‘⁶ Found that envy was to he overcome by death
alone.’' A beautiful idea. Every other monster yielded to the
prowess of Hercules: Envy alone bade defiance to his arm, and was
to be conquered only upon the hero‘s surrender of existence—13.
Urit enim sulyore sno, qui praeyravat artes, occ, ‘⁶ For he, who bears
down by superior merit the arts placed beneath him, burns by his very
splendour ;’' i. e. hc, whose superiority is oppressive to inferior minds,
excites envy by this very¹ pre-eminencc. Artes is here equivalent in
effect to artifices—14. Emitte-tus amabitur idem. When the too powerful
splendour is withdrawn, our natural veneration of it takes place.
—15. Praesenti tibi maturos laryimur honores, cxc. A happy stroke of
flattery, and which the poet with great skill makes to have a direct
bearing on liis subject. According to hini the Roman people had,
with equal justice and wisdom, heaped divine honours on Augustus,
while yet present among them ; and yct this same people vi'ere so
unfair in matters of taste, as to treat the living bard, whatever his
merit, with contempt, and to reserve their homage for those whom
they dignified with the name of ancients. 'rhus the very exception to
the general rule of merit neglected while alive, which forms the strik-
ing encomium in the case of Augustus, furnis-hes the poet with a power-
ful argument for the support of his main proposition.—ss!aturos honores.
“ Living honoursP—lo'. Jurandasque tuum per numen ponimus aras.
“ And we raise altars where men are to swear by thy din‘11ity.”

18-25, 18. In uno. “ In one thing alone.”—·20. Cetera; equi-
valent, in effect, to ceteros.—Simili ratione modoque. “By the same
rule and in the same iiianner.''—·21. Snisque temporibus defuncta.
“ And to have run out their allotted periods ;” i. e. and already past.—
23. Sic fautor veterum. “Such favourers of antiquity ;” i. e. such
strenuous advocates for the productions of earlier days. The reference
is still to the Roman people.—Tabzdas peccare vetantes. ‘⁶ The tables
forbidding to transgress ;” alluding to the twelve tables of the Roman
law, the foundation of all their jurisprudence. Horace would have
done well to have considered, if, amid the manifold improvements of
the Augustan poets, they had judged wisely in rejecting those rich and
