Gaudiis : Idus tibi sunt agendae,

Qui dies mensem Veneris marinae 15,
Findit Aprilem :

Paene natali proprio, qnod cx hac

Luce Maecenas meus affluentes
Ordinat annos. 2¹)

Non tuae sortis juvenem, puella

Dives et lasciva, tenetque grata
Compede vinetum.

Terret ambustus Phaethon avaras

Spes : et exemplum grave praebet ales
