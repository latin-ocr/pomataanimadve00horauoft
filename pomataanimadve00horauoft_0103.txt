CARMINUM Lm. 1. 27. 63

Vultt'ss {eje-ri me quoque sumere
Parte'm Falerni? dicat ΩΑῑζι-ιῃηῆᾔίειομΔ 10
Frater Megillae‚ quo beatus
Vulnere, qua pereat sagitta.

Cessat, voluntas ’.ἱ non alia bibam
Mercede. Quae te cunque domat Venus,
Ν on erubescendis adurit 15
Ignibus, ingenuoque semper

Amore peccas. Quidquid habes, age,
Depone tutis auribus—Ali miser,
Quanta laborabas Charybdi,
Digne puer meliore flamma! 20

Quae saga, quis te solvere Thessalis
Magus venenis, quis poterit deus?
Vix illigatum te triformi

Pegasus expediet Chimaerae.

10-14, 10. Opuntiae; so called from Opus, the capital of tho
opuntia„1?„1¹001‘ia- in Greece, at the northern extremity of &entim—11.
Quff'b‘ealuffi διο. The expressions beatas vulnere, aud pereat} afford
very pleasing specimens of what grammarians term the—wyssa—l&
Cessat voluntas 52 ‘⁴ Dost thou refuse?'’ Literally‚ “ Does (thy)
inclinationi hesitate?''-Non alia bibam mercede. “On no other
condition will I drink.”.-l4. Quae te cunque, διε. An encomium well
calculated to remove the bashful reserve of the youth. ‘⁸ YVhoe-ver thc fair
object may be that sways thy bosom, she causes it to bum with a flame
at which thou hast no occasion to blush, for thou always indulgest in an
honourable love.⁷’ The expression amore peccare is nothing more than
the simple amare.

18—23. 18. Ah miser! The exclamation of the poet when the
secret is divulged.—l9. Quanta laborabas, διο. The passion of the
youth is compared to the dangers of the sabled Charybdis, and hence the
expression, Quanta laborabas Charybdi is equivalent in effect to Quam
periculosam tibi puellam amabas—21. Thessalis venenis. Thessaly
was remarkable for producing numerous herbs that were used in the magical
rit-es of antiquity.—23. Vioe illiyatum, &c. “ Even Pegasus's sels will
with difficulty extricate thee from the entangling suares of this three-shaped
Chimaer-213³ Lsterally, “Pegasus will hardly extricate thee, entangled
by this three-shaped Chimaera.” In construction, triformi Chimaerae,
depending on illiyatum, is the dative put by a Graecism for the ablativo.
A new comparison is herc made, by which the female in question is made
to resemble the well-known Chimaera, or, to use the words of Diiring,
‘² Meretri-z· illa, rapacitate saa juvenum bonis infestissima, compara-
tur cum triformi illo monstro Chinzaera.'' ’
