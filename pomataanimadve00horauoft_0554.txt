512 Q.. Horum-11 FLAoeI

Scurra vagus, non qui certum praesepe teneret,

Impransus non qui civem dignosceret hoste,-

Quaelibet in quemvis opprobria fingere saevus,· 30
Pernicies et tempestas barathrumque macelli,

Quidquid quaesierat, ventri donabat avaro.

Hic, ubi nequitiae fautoribus et timidis nil

Aut paulum abstulerat, patinas coenabat omasi,

Vilis et agninae, tribus ursis quod satis esset3 35
Scilicet ut ventres lamna candente nepotum

Diceret urendos, corrector Bestius. Idem

Quidquid erat nactus praedae majoris, ubi omne

Verterat in fumum et cinerem, Non hercule miror,

fellow.”-—28. Scurra myas, non qui certam, &c- “ A wandering buf-
foon, who had no fixed eating-place ;'' who, when in want of a dinner,
could not tell a citizen from an enemy.'' As regards* the expression
scurra vagus, it may be remarked, that there were two kinds of buffoons:
some who kept entirely to one master 3 and others who changed about
from one to another, according as they met with the best entertainment.
—Praesepa Α happy term, marking out Maenius as a species of glut-
tonous animal, and serving to introduce the rest of the description.—30.
Quaelibet in quemvis opprobria fingere saevus. ‘⁶ Merciless in inventing
any calumnies against all without distinction.'' The comparison is here
indirectly made with an animal raging through want of food.—31. Per-
nicies et tempestas barathrumque macelli. ‘¹' The very destruction, hur-
ricane, and gulf of the market.'' Horace calls Maenius the ruin and
destruction of the maeket, in the same sense as Parmeno, in Terence,
(Eumaeh. 1. i. 34) styles Thais, “Fundi nostri calamitas ,·'' ἰ. e. “the
storm that ravages our thrm.”—Baratlzrum. Consult note on Sat. 11. 3.
166.—3·2. Quidquid quaesierat. “ VVhatever he had been able to
obtain.''

33—45. 33. Nequitiae fautoribus et timidis. “ From the favourers
of his scurrility, or from those who dreaded it.'' Two sources of support
for the scurra are here,a11uded to, those who directly favoured and
encouraged his abuse of others, and those who, through the dread of
suffering from it, purchased an escape by entertainments, δια-34.
Patina-s· coenabat omasi, &a “ VVould devour for supper whole dishes
of tripe, and wretched lamb.'' With aquinae supply carnis.—36. Scili-
cet ut ventres, ἃς. “ Forsooth, in order that, like another rigid Bestius,
he might declare that the bellics of gluttons ought to be branded with a
red-hot iron 3³⁹ i. e. protesting loudly all the while, to be sure, that the
bellies of gluttons ought to be branded with a red-hot iron, just as if he
had been another Bestius. The individual here alluded to under the
name of Bestius, appears to have been a close, avaricious man, and a
sworn foe, of course, to the luxurious and gluttonous spendthritts of the
day.-—Lamna candente. The Greeks and Romans, observes Dacier,
branded the belly of a gluttonous slave 3 the feet of a fugitive ; the hands
of a thief ; and the tongue of a babbler.—38. Ubi omne verterat in
