Sfflcunm Humum—In the yearof Rome 737, and when Augustus had
consolidated the energies and restored the tranquillity of the Roman
world, the period arrived for the celebration of the Saecular Games.
Among the directions given in the Sibylline Books for the due performance
of these solemnities, a hymn in praise of Apollo and Diana, to whom they
were pn'ncipally sacred, was ordered to be sung by a chorus of youths and
maidens. The composition of this hymn, on the present occasion, was
assigned by &3³ emperor to Horace, and the productiori which we are
about to consider was the result of his labours, so1ming a proud monument
of talent, and one of the noblest pieces of lyric poetry that has descended
to our times. Apollo and Diana are invoked to perpetuate their favour-ing
influence toward the Roman name. Thrice the Chorus addresses them,
and thrice the Roman Empire is confided to their care.

The Saeculum among the Romans was PEQQILZ PQ‘IQ‘} of 110 zeus,
and the Saecular Games should have been always celebrated after such an
interval. The following table, however, of the periods when they were
solemnised, will show that this rule was not much regarded.
