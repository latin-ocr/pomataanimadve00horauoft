492 Q. HORATII FLAccr

Dignum mente domoque legentis honesta Neronis,

Munere quum fungi propioris censet amici, 5
Quid possim videt ac novit me valdius ipso.

Multa quidem dixi, cur excusatus abirem:

Sed timui, mea ne finxisse minora putarer 3

Dissimulator opis propriae, mihi commodus uni.

Sic eg0‚ majoris fugiens opprobria culpae, 10
Frontis ad urbanae descendi praemia. Quod si

Depositum laudas ob amici jussa pudorem,

Scribe tui gregis hunc, et fortem crede bonumque.

prime, whereas he himself knew no such thing—3. Scilicet ut tibi se
laudare, ὅτε. “ To undertake namely to recommend and introduce him
to you.''—4. Dignum mente domoque, (xe. “As one worthy the esteem
and confidence of Nero, who always selects deserving objects ;'' i. e.
one whose habits of thinking and acting are in unison with those of the
individual addressed, and who is worthy of being numbered among his
intimate friends, and becoming a member of his household. This verse
does equal honour both to Tiberius and Septimius, since it shows the
one a disceming prince, and the other a deserving man. We are not to
consider these as words of mere comph'ment on the part of the poet.
Tiberius, in his early days, was indeed the person he is here represented
to be, a good judge of merit, and ready to reward it.-—-5. Munere funyi
propioris amici. “That Ι fill the station of an intimate ffiend.³’—‘6.
Quid possim videt, διο. “ He sees and knows what Ι can effect with
thee better than Ι do myself 3⁹³ i. e. he sees and knows the extent of my
influence with thee, &ej This explains the nimirum intelliyz't unus of
the first line.

8-13. 8. Sed timui, mea ne, διο. “ But Ι was afraid lest I might
be thought to have pretended that my interest with thee was less than
it really is ; to be a dissembler of my own strength, inclined to benefit
myself alone-''—-10. Majoris culpae. The major culpa here alluded to
is the unwfflingnesr to serve a friend—l l. Frontis ad urbanae descendi
praemia. “ I have descended into the arena to contend for the rewards
of town-bred assurance 3³⁹ i.e. Ι have resolved at last to put in for a
share of those rewards which a little city assurance is pretty certain of
obtaining. The frons urbana is sportively but truly applied to that open
and unshrinking assurance so generally found in the population of cities.
—l3. Scribe tui yreyis lmnc. “ Enrol this person among thy retinue.”

ἔξω is here taken, in a good sense, to denote a society of friends and
owexs.
