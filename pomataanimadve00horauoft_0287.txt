EPODON Lmen. 6. 247

Petamque vultus umbra curvis unguibus, i
Quae vis deorum est Manium ;

Et inquietis assidens, praecordiis, 95
Pavore somnos auferam.

Vos turba vicatim hinc et hinc saxis petens
Contundet obscenas anus.

Post insepulta membra different lupi
Et Esquilinae alites. 1ου

Neque hoc parentes, heu mihi superstites 1
Effugerit spectaculi-2112?

CARMEN VI.

QUID immerentes hospites vexas, canis,
Ignavus adversum lupos?

Quin huc inanes, si potes, vertis minas,
Et me remorsurum petis 2

-92, Nocturnus occurram Furor. ‘⁴ Ι will haunt you as a tormentor
in the night-season.''—94. Quae vis deorum, διο. “ Such is the power
of those ‹livinities the Manes.‘' The ellipsis is to be supplied as follows:
“ Εα vi quae vis est,’' &c.—97. Vicatim. ‘⁴ From street to st1·eet.’'—
98. Obscenas anns. “Filthy hags.''--99. Different. “ Shall tear.”
—100. Esquilinae alites. The birds of prcy frequented the Esquiline
quarter, because here the bodies of malefactors were left exposed, and
here also the poor, and slaves, were interred. Subsequendy, however,
the character of the place was entirely changed by the splendid residence
and gardens of Maecenas. Consult note on Ode 111. xxix. 10.—101.
Neque Ῐιοσ parentes, &c. The boy's last thoughts, observes Francis,
are tenderly employed in reflecting upon the grief of his parents3 yet he
seems to comfort them, and at the same time to confirm the truth of his
prediction, by that consolation which they shall receive in the death of
these sorceresseS.

Epona VL-Addressed to a cowardly and mcrccnary slanderer. It is
commonly thought that this piece was written against Cassius Severus, and
in many editions it appears with an inscription to this effect. Such a sup-
position‚ however, is perfectly gratuitous. It is probable that the title in
question originatcd with some scholiast, who, having read in Tacitus
(Annal. i. 72, and iv. 21) of the licentious spirit and defamatory pen of
Cassius Severus, erroneously imagined him to be the one whom the poet
here attacks.

1-14. 1. Quid immerentes, διο. “ Thou cur, why, being cowardly
against wolves, dost thou snarl at inoffensive strangers'!” By the term
hospites are here meant those who are entirely unknown to the individual,
but whom he, notwithstanding, makes the subjeets of his envenomed
attacks.--Inanes. As proceeding from a cowardly and spii-itless cur.
...4, Remorsurum. “ Who am ready to bite in return.’'--5. IWolossm,
