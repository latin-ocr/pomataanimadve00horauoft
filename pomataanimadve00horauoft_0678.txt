HISTORY OF THE GREEK DRAMA.

Fon the origin of the Grecian Drama we must go back to the annual
festivals, which, from very remote times, the village communities were
wont to celebrate at the conclusion of harvest and vintage. (Aristot.
Eth. Nic. 9. 9.—Horat. Epist. 1. 139. seqq.) On these occasions the
peasantry enjoyed periodic relaxation from their labours, and offered
grateful sacrifices to their gods. Among these gods Bacchus was a
chief object of veneration, as the inventor of wine, and the joint patron,
with Ceres, of agriculture. He appears also to have been typical of the
first generating principle. (Museum Cristcuuz, vol. ii. p. 70.) At these
meetings, that fondness for poetry and poetic recitation, ever peculiarly
strong among the Greeks, combined with their keen relish for joke and
raillery, naturally introduced two kinds of extemporaneous effusions:
the one ὑψηλὸν καὶ ἐγκωμιαστικόν, consisted of hynms addressed
immediately to Bacchus; the other, γελοιότερον καὶ ἰαμβίζον, was
the offspring of wit and wine, ludicrous and satirical, interspersed with
mutual jest and sarcasm. (Compare Epist. 11. i. 146.) The loftier
and more poetical song was afterwards called ὃιΘίιραμβος; (Mus. Crit.
vol. ii. p. 70. seqq.) a term probably derived from some ancient title
of Bacchus3 as the Paean took its name from Παιάν, an early appella-
tion of Apollo. From these rude compositions sprang the splendid
Drama of the Greeks: the Dithyramb gave birth to Tragedy, the other
to Comedy. (Compare Aristotle, Poet. 1v. 14.) In ascribing the origin
of the Drama to these simple choruses, all scholars seem to agree. With
respect to its subsequent progress and developement, down to the time
of AEschylus, considerable difference of opinion exists; as might rea-
sonably be expected on a subject known only from a few obscure
notioes scattered throughout the extant works of the ancients, and those
notiees frequently varying and contradictory. After a careful collation
of the several classic passages bearing on the question, and an exami-
nation of what has been advanced by modern critics, the following
account seems to come nearest the truth, as being consistent and pro-
bable. (Theatre [gf the Greeks, 2d. ed. p. 101. seqq.) In the first rise
of the Bacchic festivals, the peasants themselves used promiscuously to
pour forth their own unpolished and extemporaneous strains. After·
wards, the more skilful performers were selected and formed into, a
chorus, which, with the aceompaniment of the pipe, sang verses pre-
composed by the Dithyrambic poets. These poets at the outset were,
like the chorus, simple pecsants, distinguished above their fellow-
labourers by their natural and uncultivated talent for versifying3 who,
against these festive occasions, used to provide the chorus with a hymn.
They in time became a numerous and peculiar body. Emulation was
excited, contests between the choruses of neighbouring districts speedily
arose, and an ox was assigned as the prize of superior skiu. (Pindar‚ Ol.
