Ignotum tragicae genus invenisse Camenae 275
Dicitur et plaustris vexisse poemata Thespis
Qui canerent agerentque peruncti faecibus ora.
Post hunc personae pallaeque repertor honestae
Aeschylus et modicis instravit pulpita tignis,
Et docuit magnumque loqui nitique cothurno. 280
Successit vetus his Comoedia, non sine multa
Laude 3 sed in vitium libertas excidit, et vim
Dignam lege regi. Lex est accepta, Chorusque
Turpiter obticuit, sublato jure nocendi.
Nil intentatum nostri liquere poetae z ‘285
Nec minimum meruere decus, vestigia Graeca
Ausi deserere, et celebrare domestica facta,

Vel qui praetextas, vel qui docuere togatas.

and ear.’' The allusion in digitis is to the use made of the fingers in
measuring the quantity of the verse.

275-279. 275. Ignotum tragicae 9enus, &c- “Thespis is said to
have invented a species of tragedy before unknown to the Greeks.’'
Horace does not mean to say, that Tragedy actually commenced with
Thespis, but that he was the author of a new and important step in the
progress of the Drama—276. Et plaustris vexisse poemata, διο. The
order of construction is, et vexisse plaustris histriones, qui, peruncti ora
faecibus, canerent agerentque poemata ejus—277. Perunctrj foecibus ora.
In the earlier age of tragedy, observes Blomfield, the actors smeared
their faces either with the lees of wine, or with a kind of paint called
βατραχεῖον. Different actors invented different masks. Who first in-
troduced them into comedy is unknown, but Aischylus first used them
in tragedy.-278. Post hunc personae, διο. Consult the Excursus at the
end of this volume.—279. Pnlpita. Consult Ere-ursus.

several changes in the Greek Comedy, and its division into the Old,
the Middle, and the New, consult note on Sat. 1. iv. 2. 283. Chorus-
que turpiter obticuit, &c. Evidently, observes Hurd (alluding to the
words turpiter obticuit), because, though the jus nocendi was taken away,
yet that was no good reason why the chorus should entirely cease.
onperly speikz'ng, the law only abolished the abiise of the chorus.
The ignominy lay in dropping the entire use of it, on account of
this restraint. Horace was of opinion, that the chorus ought to have
been retained, though the state had abridged it of the license it so much
delighted in, of an unlimited and intemperate satire—288. Vel qui
praetextas, vel qui docuere togatas. “ Whether they have composed tra·
gedies or comedies for the stage.’' Docere subulam isanalogous to the
Greek expression διδάσκειν δρᾶμα, and properly means to “teacha
play,'' i. e. to the actors. Since, from the state of writing materials,
the performers could not enjoy the convenience of frequent transcription
of their parts, they studied them by the poet's repeatedly reading
