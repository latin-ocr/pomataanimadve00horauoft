—26. Interpellandi locus hic erat. “An opportunity here offered
itself sor interrupting him.'’ The poor bard, driven to despair bs.- thc
garrulity of his new acquaintance, and finding it impossible to shake him
off, seeks some little relief under his misery hy endeavouring to change
the conversation, and introduce the subject of his neighbonr’s extraction.
He aska him, therefore, if he has a mother living? if he has any rela-

“Who are interested in thy welfare ?'' i. e. who are wrapped up in the
sasety and preservatiou of so valuable a man as thou. The poet, driven
to extremities, indulges in a sneer at his persecutor3 but the armour of
the other is proof against the blow.—28. Omnes composui. ‘⁴ I have laid
them all at rest;” i. e. I have buried them all. The talkative fcllow
wishes to intimate to Horace, how able he is to serve the hard as well
as all other friends, from the circumstance of his being free from the
claims of any relatives on his time and attention—Felices! From this

poet. Nothing can be more amusing than to picture to ourselves the
poor hard, moving along with drooping head, and revolving iu mind his
gloomy destiny. Tho prediction‚ of course, to which he alludes, is a mere
fiction, and got up expressly for the occasion.

vi. 38.—30. Mota divina anus urna. ‘⁸ After the old creature had
divined my destinies by shaking her magio urn.'' The divination here
alluded to was performed in the following manner: A number of lettere
and entire words were thrown into an urn, and shaken together. When
they were all well mixed, they were thrown out, and, from the arrange—
ment thus brought about by chance, the witch formed her answer
respecting the future fortunes of the person that consulted hen-31.

The poet escaped from the battle-field. (Ode ιι. vii. 10.)-32. Laterum
dolor. “ Pleurisy.”-33. Quando consumet cunque. A tmesis for
quandocunque consumet. ‘⁴ Shall one day or other make away with.''
—35. Ventum erat ad Vestae. Understand templum. This temple
would seem to have stood between the Via Nova and that continuation
or branchos the Via Sacra which issucd from the western angle of the
Forum.·--36. Et casu tune respondere vadato debebat. “ And· it so
happened, that he had to answer in court to a person who had held him
to bail.” Vadam· aliquem in to compel any one to give bail sor hin
