408 Q. HORATII PLACCI

Post vinum stomach03 perna magis ac magis hillis 60
Flagitat immorsus refici : quin omnia malit,
Quaecunque immundis fervent allata popinis.
Est operae pretium duplicis pernoscere juris
Naturam. Simplex 6 (111161 constat olivo,
Quod pingui miscere mero muriaque decebit, 65

Pressa Venafranae quod bacca remisit olivae.

tuce, therefore, at this time closed the entertainments of the Romans.
(Compare Apicius, 111. 18, and virgil, Moret. 76.) At a later period,
however, we find it actually used at the beginning of the coena, (compare
Martial, xiii. 14‚) which may be some defence for Catius against the ridi-
cule of commentators.—60. Perna mayis ac mayis hillis, &c‚
“Aroused by ham rather, and by sausages rather, than by this, it seeks
to be restored to its former powers.” Supply stomachus, not potor as
some insist. The allusion is to the effect of salt food on a languid sto-
mach, in exciting a 1611511, and rousing to fresh exertion.—H3llis.
The term hillae properly denotes the intestines of animals, aud is a dimi-
nutive from him—61. Quin omnia malit, &c According to Catius, a
languid stomach will prefer any thing to lettuce ; even the dishes that are
brought stom dirty cook-shops.—6·2. Fervent allata.» For afferuntur
ferventia. “Are brought hot and steaming.”

63—69. 63. Duplicis juris. “Of the mixed kind of sauce.” The
common, but incorrect, mode of rendering these words is, “of the two
kinds of sauce.” Catius first speaks of the jus simplem, down to the end
of verse 66 ; he then proceeds to state how this may be converted
into the jas dupleoe5 so that the whole passage, from the 64th to the
69th verses inclusive, is, in fact, a description of the latter. -64. Dulci.
“Fresh, ·” equivalent here to recente, and opposed to rancido. -65.
Pingui mero. “With old rich wine. The epithet pinque seems to
allude to that oily appearance and taste which the more genereus wines
acquire by age. -66. Quam qua Byzantia putuit orca. “Thau that
with which the Byzantine jar has been tainted.” The allusion' 1s to the
Byzantine pickle made of the tunny- -,fish which were taken 111 large
numbers near that city. This is pronounced by Catius to 116 the best,
and the term putuit, as used in the text, will serve to give us some idea
of its pungent odour. -Ονεα, Α large vessel or jar, round below, and
having a narrow neck. It derived its name from the resemblance it bore
to the fish termed orcc'z. —67. Hoc ubi confusum sectis, &c. “When
this, after herbs cut small have been mixed in, has 116611 made to boil,
and has then stood to cool for a time, sprink'led over with Coryciari
saffron.'' Stetit here refers not only to the placing of the sauce apart
from the fire, but also, and in a more particular sense, to the thickening
or concretion which results from the process of coming—68. Corycio.
The Corycian saffron was produced in the vicinity of Corycus, 3 town on
the coast of Cilicia Campestris, south-east of Seleucia Trachea. It was
