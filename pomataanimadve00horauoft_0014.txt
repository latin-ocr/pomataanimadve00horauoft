X LII-'E OF IIORACE.

table occasion the poet himself has left us an account. He acknow-

ledges, in an ode imitated from Archilochus, that he threw away his
..bucklen and saved himself by a precipitate retreat 3 a confession which

some have regarded as the mere effusion ofa sportive muse, while

others have dignified it with the appellation of history. The truth

unquestionably lies between either extreme. There is no ground sor

the supposition‚ that Horace abandoned the conflict before the rest of

his party; nor would he as a Roman have acknowledged his rapid
ssight, had it not been inevitable and shared by his companions. An
amnesty having been proclaimed to those who should surrender them-

selves, we find Horace embracing this opportunity of quitting the
republican ranks and returning to his country. At Home} lio'w‘eferss
’ fresh missortuues awaited him. During the interval of his absence,
his father had paid the debt of nature, his scanty inheritance was
ruiued or confiscated, and the political horizon seemed unpropitious
’ to any hope which the young Venusian might have entertained of
future advancement. Naturally indolent, and of a character strongly
marked by a diffidence in his own abilities, it may well be imagined
that Horace needed some excitement as powerful as this to call his
latent energies into action. ‘⁴ Poverty,'' exclaims the bard, ‘⁶ drove
me to write verses ;⁷' and poverty, we may add, proved the harbinger
of his fame. Among the generous friends who fostered his rising
talents, and whose approbation encouraged him to persevere in the
cultivation of his poetic powers, were Yirgil and Varus 3 by the
former of whom he was recommended, at the age of twenty-seven, to
the notice of Maecenas, aud at a subsequent period by the latter. The
account which the poet has left us of his first interview is extremely
interesting. He appears before his future patron abashed and diffident.
His previous history is told in a few words ι the reply of Maecenas is
equally brief ; and nine months are suffered to elapse before any far-
ther notice is taken by him of the candidate for his favour. When this
period of probation is at an eud, during which the poet has degraded
his muse by no offering of servile adulatiom he isfunexpectedly sum-
moned into the presence of Maecenas, and soon finds himself iu the
number of his domestic and most intimate friends. Indeed friendship,
in the ordinary acceptation of the term, seems too cold and formal a
word to denote that warm tone of almost fraternal feeling which sub-
sisted between the bard and his generous patron. That the poetical
abilities of Horace contributed largely towards cementing a union so
honourable to both, cannot be denied. And yet it is equally apparent,
that even if those abilities had not been what they were, still his
pleasing manners, his sterling sense, his refined and elegant wit, but,
above all, his deep and accurate knowledge of human nature, would of
themselves have secured to Horace the confidence and affection of his
friend. After this auspicious change in his fortunes, the horizon of
the poet, like the glassy surface of his own Bandusian sonutam, was
all serenity and peace. A romantio villa at Tibur, on the banks of
the Anio, and a secluded farm in the eastern extremity of the country
of the Sabines, were among the favours received at the hands of Mae·
cenas 3 but the most important benefit of all was the friendship and
patr-onage of his imperial master. ⁴ Amid all this prosperity, however,
the mind of the poet appears never to have deviated from its accus-
tomed equanimity. With the means of possessing an ample fortune·
