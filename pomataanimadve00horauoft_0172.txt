132 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Dux inquieti turbidus Adriane, 5
N ec fulminantis magna, manus J ovis:
Si fractus illabatur orbis,
Impavidum ferient ruinae.

Hac arte Pollfix et vagus Hercules
Enisus arces attigit igneas : ’ 10
Quos inter Angustus recumbens
Purpureo bibit ore nectar.

Hac te merentem, Bacche pater, tuae
Vexere tigres, indocili jugum
Collo trahentes. Hac Quirinus 15
Martis equis Acheronta fugit,

Romulus, the poet dwells on the circumstances which, to the eye of ima-
gination, attended his apotheosis. The gods are assembled in solemn
conclave, to decide upon his admission to the skies. Juno, most hostile
before to the line of Aeneas, now declares her assent. Satisfied with past
triumphs, she allows the founder of the eternal city to participate in the
joys of Olympus. The lofty destinies cf Rome are also shadowed forth,
and the conquest of nations is promised to her arms. But the condition
which accompanies this expression of her will is sternly mentioned. The
city of Troy must never rise from its ashes. Should the descendants of
Romulus rebuild the detestcd city, the vengeance of the goddess will again
he exerted for its downfal.

Itis a conjecture of Faber's (Epist. ii. 43) that Horace wishes,' in the
present ode, to dissuade Agu ustus from executing a plan he had at this
time in view, <ff traiisfening ssie seat of empire from Rome to Ilium, and
of rebuilding {he city of Priam. Suetonius (Vit. Jul.) speaks of a similar
piojcct in the time of Caesar. Zosimus also states, that, in a later age,
Constantine actually commenced building a new capital in the plain of
Troy. but was soon induced Ἦγ the superior situation of Βμειιιῐίιιιιι to

“ abandon his project. (Zos ii. 30“)””“

1—22.1.Justum ac tenacem, διο. “ Not the wild fury of his
follow-citizens ordering evil measures to be pursued, not the look of the
threatening tyram, nor the southern blast, the stormy ruler of the restless
Adriatic, nor the mighty hand of Jove wielding his thunderbolts, shakes
from his settled purpose the man who is just and firm in his resolve.'’
In this noble stanza that firmness alone is praised which rests onrthe
basis of integrity and justice.—7. Si fractus illabatur orbis, ἃς..

remaining a stranger to fear.”——9. Hac arte. ’ὅ By this rule of con-
