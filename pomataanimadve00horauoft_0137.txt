returned to Rome, but Pompeius continued in arum, and was only
restored to his native country when the peace conclnded between the
triumvirs and Sextus Ponipey cnablcd the exiles aud proscribed of the
republican party to revisit their homes. The bard indulges iu the pre-
sent effusion on the restoration of his friend.

tho this friend was, is sur froin being clearly ascertaincd. Most
commentators make him to have been Pompeius Grosphus, a Roman
knight. and freedman of Poinpcy the Great. lf this opinion be correct,
hc will be the same nith the individual to whom the sixteenth ode of the
present book is inscribed, and who is also mentioned in Epist. 1. xii. 23.
Vanderbourg, however, is in favour of Pompeius Varus. ¹* Les mss.,'’
observes this editor, ‘⁴ ne sont point ‹l‘accord sur les nonis de cet ami de
notre poe'te. J'ai cru longtcinps avec Sanadon, et MM. Wetzel et
Mitschcrlich, devoir le confundi-e avec le Pompeius Grosphus de l'Ode
l6, de ce livre, et de l'Epitre 12, ‹lu liv. i.; mais je pense aujourd'hui
avec les :inciens commentateurs, suivis en cela par Dacicr ct M. Voss,
que Pompeius Varus etaient ses nom et surnom veritablcs.’'

greatest danger.''—3. Quis te redonavit Quiritem. “ who has restored
thee as a Roman citizen Γ The name Quiritem here implics a full
return to all the rights and privileges of citizenship, which had ,been for-
feited by his bearing arms against the established authority of tho
triumvirate.—6. Cum quo morantem, διε. “ Along with whom I have
often broken the linge-ring day with wine.'' Compare note on Ode r. i.
20.—8. Malobatlzro Syrio. “With Syrian malobathrum.” Pliny (Hist.
Nat. xii. 26) mentions three kinds of malobathrum, the Syrian, Egyptian,
and Indian, of which the last was the best. The Indian, being conveyed
across the, deserts of Syria by the caravan trade to the Mediterranean
coast, received from the Romans, in common with the first-mentioned
species, the appellation of ‘⁶ Syrian.” Some diversity of opinion, how-
ever, exists with regat-d to this production. Pliny describes it as follows:
“In paludibus yiyni tradunt lentis modo, odoratius croco, nigricans
scabrumque, quodam satis yustu. M inus probatur candidum. Celer-
rime situm in vetustate sentit. Sapor ejus nardo similis debet esse sub
linqua. Odor vero int-ino suffervefacti antecedit alios.'' Some have sup-
posed it to be the same with the bctcl or betre, for an account of which con—

however, thinks that it was probably a compound extract of a number of
plante with odoriferous leaves, such as the laurel called in Malabar
Famula, and the nymphea called Famara in Sanscrit3 the termination
