the Campanian shore. It was, properly speaking, a part of the sea shut in
by a dikc thrown across a nari-ow inlet. The lake has entirely ‹lisnppeared‚
owing to a subterraneous eruption which took place in 1538, whercby the
hill called Monte Nuovo was raised, and the water displaced. This lake
was famed for its oysters and other shell-fish.-Sla9na. ‘⁴ Fish-ponds.'’
Equivalent here to piscinae.-—-Platanusque coelebs, διε. “ And the bar-
ren plaue-tree shall take the place of the elms.” The plane-trec was
merely ornamental, whereas the clms were useful for rearing the vines.
Hence the meaning of the poet is, that utility shall bc made to yield to the
mere gmtification of the eye. The plane-trec was never employed for rear-
ing the vine, and hence is called coelebs, whereas the elm was chiefly
used for this purpose—5. Violaria. “ Beds of violets.”—6. Omnis
copia narium. ‘⁴ All the riches of the smell.'' ἱ. e. every fragrant flower.
—7. Sparyent olivetis odorem. “ Shall scatter their pei-sume among the
olive ground‚’⁷ i. e. the olive shall be made to give place to the violet, the
myrtle, and every sweet-seented plant.

9.—-20. 9. Fervidos ictus. Understand solis.—10. Non ita Romuli,
&c- “Such is not the rule of conduct prescribed by the examples os
Romulus and the unshorn Cato, and by the simple lives of our fathers.''
As regards the epithet intonsi, which is intended to designate the plain and
austere manners of Cato, consult note Ode 1. xii. 4l.-l3. Privatus illis,
&c. “ Their private fortunes were small, the public resources extensive.”
—14. Nulla decempedis, &e. “ No portico measured for private indi·
viduals Ly rods ten feet in length, received the cool breezes of the North.''
The allusion is to a portico so large in size as to be measured by rods of
these dimensions, as also to the custom, on the part of the Romam, os
having those portioris of their villas that were to be occupied in summer
