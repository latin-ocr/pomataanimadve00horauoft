³62 Q. IIORATII FLACCI

TREBATIUS.

Attamen et justum poteras et scribere fortem,
Scipiadam ut sapiens Lucilius.

HORATIUS.

Haud mihi deero,
Quum res ipsa feret; nisi dextro tempore Flacci
Verba per attentam non ibunt Caesaris aurem3

Cui male si palpere, recalcitret undique tutus. 20

TREBATIUS.
Quanto rectius 1100, quam tristi laedere versu
Pantolabum scurram Nomentanumque nepotem!

Quum sibi quisque timet, quamquam est intactus, et odit.

cuspide Gallos. An allusion to the contrivance which Marius made use
of in his engagement with the Cimbri. Until then the Romans had
been accustomed to fasten the shaft of the pilum to the iron head with
two iron pins. But Marius, on this occasion, letting one of them remain
as it was, had the other taken out, and a weak wooden peg put in its
place. By this he intended, that, when the pilam struck in the enemy’s
snield, it should not stand right out 3 but that the wooden peg breaking,
and the iron pin bending, the shafl: of the weapon should drag upon the
ground, while the point stuck fast in the shield. The Cimbri, it will be
perceived, although of Germanic origin, are here called by the appellation
of Galli. The Germans and Gauls were frequently confounded by the
Roman writers. —16. Et justum et fortem. “Both just and energetic. '⁹
—17. Scipiadam ut sapzens Lucilius. “As the discreet Lucilius did
Scipio. ’³ Scipiadam 1s put for the more regular patronymic form Scipio-
niadem. The allusion 15 either to the elder or younger Afi‘icanus, but to
which of the two is not clearly ascertained. Most probably the latter 1s
meant, as Lucilius lived on terms of the closest intimacy with both him
and his friend Laelius. Horace styles Lucilius“ sapiens‚' 'discreet, with
reference, no doubt, to his 5010011011 of a subject3 Lucilius having con-
fined himself to 1110 pacific virtues of his hero, and thus having avoided
the presumption of rix palling Ennius, who had written of the warlike ex-
ploits of the elder Africanus.

kiek back upon him, being at all quarters on his guardss’ Horace here
compares Augustus to a spirited horse, which suffers itself with pleasure
to be caressed by a skilful hand, bu’t winces and kicks at those that
touch him roughly. The idea intended to be conveyed by the whole
passage is this ,—that the productions of the bard, if well- timed‚ will be
sure to elicit t’he attention of Augustus3 whereas, shielded as heis 011
every side against the arts of flatterers, he will reject ill- timed praise
with scorn and contempt.—- -21, Hoc. “This course3 'i. e. to celebrate
the exploits of Augustus—Tristi laedere versu. “To attack in bitter
verse.”-‘2·2. Pantolabum scurram, διο. Τ1115 11110 has already mmm-ed,
