300 Q. nonArn FLACCI

Balbutit Scaurum, pravis fultum male talis.
Parcius hic vivit? frugi dicatur. Ineptus
Et jactantior hie paulo est? concinnus amicis 50
Postulat ut videatur. At est truculentior atque
Plus aequo liber? simplex fortisque habeatur.
Caldior est? aeres inter numeretur. Opinor,
Haec res et jungit, junctos et servat amicos.
At nos virtutes ipsas invertimus atque 55
Sincerum cupimus vas incrustare. Probus quis
Nobiscum vivit? multum est demissus homo? Illi
'sardo cognomen pingui et damus. Hic fugit omnes
Insidias, nullique malo latus obdit apertum?

chieftain of fabulous times—47. Varum. ‘⁶ A Varus.”-.48.Scaurum.
‘⁴ One of the Scauri.” It will be observed that all the names here given
by the poet, Paetus, Pullus, Varus, and Scaurus, were surnames of
Roman families moro or less celebrated. This iinparts a peculial· spirit
to the original, especially iu the case of the two latter, where the parent

as au epithet, denotes one who has the legs bent inwards, or as the scho-
liast expresses it, ‘⁹ cujus pedes introrsum retortae sunt) ' ¹ The opposite

of the rule which thc poet wishes to sce established in matters of friend-
ship.-5l. At est truculentior, διε. “But is he t'oo rude, and more
free in what hc says than is consistent with propriety? let him be
regarded as one who speaks just what hc thinks, and who is a stranger
to all fear.’'—53. Caldior est 52 acres iuter numeretur. ‘⁶ Is he too
quick and passionate? let him be reekoned among men of spirit.'’-—55.
At nos virtutes ipsas invertimus, &cu “ We, however, misrepresent
