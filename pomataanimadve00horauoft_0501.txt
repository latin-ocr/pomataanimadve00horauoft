opinions undergo as many changes as Proteus was capable of assuming
forms.-9l. Quid pauper? ride, ut ηιιιέαΐ, ἃς. lt might well seem
that this inconsistent-y, this wandering of spirit, was pcculiar to the
rich alone ; but it is the t'olly of human nature, to which the poor are
, equally liable, although they are guilty of it only in miniature.——Coen(.·-

By coenaczda are meant the highest chambers or apartments in a house,
those immediately under the roof, which at Rome, in consequence ot·
the great population of the city, and the want of other accommodations,
were filled by the poorer sort of people. Compare Vitruvius, ii. 8, acl
fin. The term lectos is meant to refer to the place of supping, some
eating-house or tavern, which the poor man changes with as much fas-
n‘djous caprice as the n'ch do the scencs of their splendid entemain-
ments. As to the balnea, or baths, it may be remarked, that these
were the public ones, which the poor were accustomed to use ; for the
rich had private baths of their own: while, as the number of tonstrina»,
or barbers’ shops, was far from small, a person might easily consult
variety in changing from one to another at pleasme.-9·2. Conclzccto

94-104. 94. Car-atus inaequali tonsore capillos, ‘W ith my hair cut
by an uneven barber; ’1. e. in an unev en manner. By the expression
inaequalis tonsor is meant, in fact, a barber who cuts in an uneven man-
ner. Horace, in this, as well as in what follows, applies to himself,
not what. properly belongs to him, but to any individual who comes
forth into public in the state here described—95. Si sorte subucula
pexae‚&c. “ If Ι chance to have a threadbare shirt under a new tunic.''
The subucula was a woollen gannent, worn next the skin, like the mo-
dem 811111. It was also called Indusium, and by later writers, [merula
and Comma. Linen clothes were not used by the ancient Roinans, and
are seldom mentioned in the classics. —Peoeae; literally, ‘⁶ with the
