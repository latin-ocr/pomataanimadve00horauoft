EPISTOLA IV
AD ALBmM TIBULLUM.

ALBI, nostrorum sermonum candide judex,

Quid nunc te dicam facere in regione Pedana?

Scribere quod Cassi Parmensis opuscula vincat,

An tacitum silvas inter reptare salubres,

Ourantem quidquid dignum sapiente bonoque est ἓ 5
Non tu corpus eras sine pectore. D'i tibi formam,

Di tibi divitias dederant, artemque fruendi.

Quid voveat dulci nutricula majus alumno,

Qui sapere et fari possit quae sentiat, et cui

Gratia, fama, valetudo contingat abunde, 10

Errs'rLE IV.—Horace inquires of the poet Tibullus, whether he is
occupied at his villa with writing verses, or roanis about in its vicinity,
and muses on the best way of spending existence. After passing some
encomiums on the mental and personal accomplishments of his friend,
our poet invites him to his abode.

to be remarked, that the term sermo, as applied to the satirical produc-

style. Compare Sat. 1. i. zia—2. In regione Pedana. ‘⁶ In the
country about Pedum.'' Pedum was a town of Latium, often named in
the early wars of Rome, and which must be placed in the vicinity of
Praeneste. Tibullus possessed a villain the regio Pedana, which was
all that remained of his property, the rest having been confiscated in the
proscriptions of 711 and 712.—Cass2 Parmensis. ‘⁴ Cassius of Parma,''
here mentioned, appears to hare been a distinct person from the Etru-
rian Cassius, spoken of in Sat. 1. X. 61. He is described by one of
the scholiasts, as having tried his strength in various kinds of poetry,
and to have succeeded best in elegiae and epigrammatic writing.

4—10. 4. Αη tacitum silvas inter, &a ‘⁶ Or that thou art saunter-
ing silently amid the healthful woods.''—-5. Quidquid dignum sapiente
bonoque est. The subject of meditation here indicated is, the best
means of attaining to happiness, and enjoying, in a proper manner, the

favours of the gods—6. Non tu corpus eras sine pectore. ‘⁴ Thou wast ¹

not a mere body without a nn‘ncw The reference is to the hour of his
birth, and the passage may therefore be paraphrased as follows:

“And the true art of enjoying them.”--8. Voveat. In the sense of
optet.—Nutricula. “An affectionate umes-Ammo, qni sapere et

is to ability in public speaking—10. Gratia. ‘⁴ Influence.” We have
