25-27, 25. Quem Venus, διε. The ancients at their scasts ap-
pointed a person to preside by throwing the dice, whom they called arbiter
bibendi, (συμπυσιάρχης,) “ master of the feast.” Hc directed everything
at pleasure. In playing at games of chance they used three tesserae and
four tali. The tesserae had six sides, marked Ι. II. ΙΙΙ. IV. V. VI.; the
tali had four sides longwise, for the two ends were not regarded. On one
side was marked one point, (unio, an ace, called Canis‚) and on the oppo—
site side six3 (Senem) while on the two other sides were three and four
(ternio et quaternio). The highest or most fortunate throw was called
Venus, and determined the direction of the feast. It ww, of the tesserae,
three sixes ; of the tali, when all of them came out different numbers. The
worst or lowest thr->w was termed Canis, and was, of the tesserae, three
aces; and of the tali, when they were all the same. Compare Reitz, ad
