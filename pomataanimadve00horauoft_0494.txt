452 Q. HonATn PLACCI

Quid verum atque decens curo ct r0g0, et omnis in hoc
sum 3
Condo et compono, quae mox depromere possim.
Ac ne forte roges, quo me duce, quo lare tuter3
Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri,
Quo me cunque rapit tempestas, deferor hospes. 15
N unc agilis fio et mersor civilibus undis,
Virtutis verae custos rigidusque satelles ,-
N unc in Aristippi furtim praecepta relabor,
Et mihi res, non me rebus subjungere conor.

other things of a sportive nature.”—1 l. Et omnis in hoc sum. “ And
am wholly engaged in this.”—l2. Condo et compono, quae mox¹ depro-
mere possz'm.. “ I treasure up and digest what Ι may at some future
period draw forth into action.'' The reference here is to the precepts
of philosophy.

13—15. 13. Quo me (Ince, quo lare tuter. “Under what guide,
under what sect Ι take shelter.” Lar is here equivalent to familia, a
term frequently applied by the Roman wn‘ters to denote a philosophical
seen—14. Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri. ‘⁶ Bound to swear
to the tenets of no particular master 3⁹³ i. e. blindly addicted to the
tenets of no particular sect. The addicti were properly those debtors
whom the praetor adjudged to their creditors, to be committed to prison,
or otherwise seeured‚ until satisfaction was made. Soldiers', however,
were also called addicti, in allusion to the military oath which they took
when enrolled. It is in this last sense that Horace here uses the word,
an idea arising probably from ducein the preceding verse. The ex-
pression addictus jurare is a Graecism for addictus ut jurem—15. Quo
me cunque rapit tempestas deferor hospes. A pleasing image, borrowed
from the sea. “Whithersoever the tempest hurries me, thither am I
borne a guest 3⁵⁹ z'. e. to the writings of whatsoever philosopher the in-
clination of the moment, or the course of events, shall drive me, with
them do Ι take up my abode‚ but only as a guest, and as one who
intends, when circumstances shall demand it, to retire to some other
quarter. The poet here describes himself as a species of eclectio philo-
sopher, culling from the doctrines of different sects whatever appears to
approach nearest to the truth, but blindly following the general authority
of none.

16—18. 16. Nunc ayilz's fio, &c. “ Now I become an active man,
and plunge amid the waves of public life ;'' i. e. now I follow the pre-
cepts of the Stoic sect, and lead an active life amid the bustle of public
affairs. The Stoics directly inculcated the propriety of their wise man's
exerting his best endeavours for the general welfare of those around
him, and the common good of mankind. Attention to civil or public
affairs would be a necessary consequence of this mla—18. Nunc in
Aristippi furtim, &c. “ Now Ι glide back insensibly into the precepts
of Aristippus.” Aristippus, the founder of the Cyrenaic sect, made the
summum bonum consist in pleasure. Consult note on Sat. 11. 11. 99.
