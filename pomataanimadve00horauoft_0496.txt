²54 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Fervet avaritia miseroque cupidine pectus 2

Sunt verba et voces, quibus hunc lenire dolorem

Possis, et magnam morbi deponere partem. 35

Laudis amore tumes? sunt certa piacula, quae te

Ter pure lecto poterunt recreare libello.

Invidus, iracundus, inem, vinosus, amator?

Nemo adeo ferus est, ut non mitescere possit,

Si modo culturae patientem commodet aurem. 40
Virtus est vitium fugere, et sapientia prima

Stultitia caruisse. Vides, quae maxima credis

Esse mala, exiguum censum turpemque repulsam,

Quanto devites animo capitisque labore.

creasing our wealth is here strongly marked. The former dares not
enjoy what it possesses, the latter ardently wishes for whatever seems to

charms.' The precepts of philosoph), by which we are commanded to
drive from our breasts ev ely araricious and coxetous feeling, are here

to the popular belief, diseases were thou« ght to be expelled from the

human fiame.

of praise? ⁹ ι’. e. art thou influenced bf: an eager desire for praise?
Tumeo is frequently thus applied to denote any strong affection or desire
under the influence of which the mind, as it were, swells forth—Sunt
certa piacula, qnae te, &a ‘⁶ There are sure and cleansing remedies‚
which will restore thee to moral health, if some treatise of philosophy be
thrice read over with purity of n1ind.·’-—P;‹1cnla. Compare the remark
of Cruquius z “ Piacula: ⁴Medicamenta ])n¹7·y(1ntia‚ καθάρσεις, i. e. proe-
cepta philosophica.”—37. Ter pure lecto. The number three, as here
employed, appears to contain some allusion to the religious customs of
antiqusty, in accordance with which, they who purified themselves were
compelled to sprinkle their persons thrice with lusti-al water, or thrice to
plunge the head in some running streanr-33. Amator. “ Libidinous.''

—40. culturae. ‘⁶ To the lessons of wisdom.” Compare the explana- -

tion of Doring 3· ‘⁶ Culturae z praeceptis, quihus animus excolatur? Phi-
losophy, says Cicero, is the culture of the mind3 (cultura animi philoso-
phia est;) it tears up our vices by the roots; it prepares the sou] to
receive the seeds of virtue, and sows whatever will produce the most
plentiful harvest.
