200 Q. HORATH FLACCI

Videre Raetis bella sub Alpibus
Drusum gerentem Vindelici ε [quibus
Mos unde deductus per omne
Tempus Amazonia securi 20

Dextras obarmet, quaerere distuli ε
Nec scire fas est onmia :] sed diu
Lateque victrices catervae,
Consiliis juvenis revictae,

Sensere, quid mens rite, quid indoles, 25

Posset, quid Augusti paternus
In pueros animus Nerones.

Fortes creantur fortibus ε et bonis
Est in juvencis, est in equis patrum 30
Virtus: neque imbellem feroces
Progenerant aquilae columbam.

the foe with an Amazonian battle-axe, 1 have omitted to inquire.’' The
awkwardness of the whole clause, from quibus to omnia, has very justly
caused it to be suspected as an interpolation: we have, therefore, placed
the whole within brackets.———‘.20. Amazonia securi. The Amazonian
battle-axe was a double one; that is, beside its edge it had a sharp projec-
tion, like a spike, on the top.—21. Obarmet. The verb obarmo means

24-33. 24. Consiliis juvenis revictae. “ Subdued in their turn
by the skilful operations of a youthful warrior.” Consult Introductory
Remarks.—25. Sensere quid mens, διε, “ Felt what a. mind, what a
