EPODON LIBER. 17. 267

Per et Dianae non movenda numina,
Per atque libros carminum valentium
Defixa coelo devocare sidera,
Canidia, parce vocibus tandem sacris,
Citumque retro solve, solve turbinem.
Movit nepotem Telephus Ν ereium,
In quem superbus ordinarat agmina
Mysorum, et in quem tela acuta torserat, 10
Unxere matres Iliae addictum feris

Alitibus atque canibus homicidam Hectorem,
Postquam relictis moenibus rex procidit

Heu Ξ pervicacis ad pedes Achillei.

Setosa duris exuere pellibus 15

battle. —2. Reyna per Proserpinae, ἃς. ‘By the realms of Proserpina,
and by the power of Hecate, not to be provoked with impunity‚ and bx·
thy books of enchantments,” διε. The poet here adjures Canidia by the
things which she most revered, and with which, as a sorceress, she was
supposed to be most conversante-5. Defia'a. “Bound by thy incanta-
* tions to obey.'' The verb defiyo is peculiar in this sense to magio rites.
Hence it frequently answers to our verb, “to bewitch.”-—7. Citumque
retro solve, διο. “ And turn backward, turn thy swift-revolving wlieel.''
The turbo, equivalent to the Greek ῥόμβος, was a species of wheel much
used in magio rites. A thread or yarn was attached to it, which began to
wind around on the wheel's being made to revolve3 and, as this process
was going on, the individual, who was the subject of the ceremony, was
supposed to come more and more under the power of the sorceress.
Horace, therefore, entreats Canidia to turn her magic wheel backward,
and untwine the fatal thread, that he may be freed from the spell in which
she had bound him.

8—23. 8. Ivlovil, · understand ad misericordiam The poet heightens
the ridicule of the piece‚ by citing Achilles and Circe as examples of imita-
tion for the worthless Canidia. ——Nepotem Neretum. Achilles. —Tele-
phus. A king of Mysia, who led an army against the Greeks when they
had lauded on his coasts, and was w,ounded and afterwards cnred, by
Achilles.—ll. Unoeere matres Iliae, διο. ‘The Trojan matrons
anointed the corpse of Hector, slaughterer of heroes, originally doomed
to voracious birds and dogs,'' &c. The idea intended to be oonveyed is,
that tho Trojan mati-ons were enabled to perform the last sad offices to the
corpse of Hector, in consequence of the relenting of Achilles at the sup-
plications of Priame—14. Pervicacis Achillei. “Of Achilles, however
inflexible.'' Compare Ode 1. vi. 6.-15. Setosa duris, &c. “ Divested
their bristly limbs of the hard skins of swine ; ” ἱ. e. ceased to be swine;
an allusion to the fable of Circe, and the transformation of the followers of
mysses into swine, as well as to their subsequent restoration by the sor—

ccress, on the interference of the chiefgain of Ithaca—17. Tunc mens et
