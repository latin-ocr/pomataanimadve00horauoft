xxviii METRES or HORACE.

REdEJth fid 11 veros Ι ιῖπιῦΙΙνέε.
Horace frequently uses this speeies of verse in conjunction with the

Alcaic2 and always has the third foot a spondee : for the line, which in the
common editions runs thus,

Disjeelcii ηῦη l! ῖέυἱ l νῦῐΗηᾶ,

is more correctly read with ἰέηἱ in place of ἰέυἱ.

9. Ammaous IAMBIC Dmnrfflz.

This is the Iambic Dimeter (No. 7.) wanting the first syllable 3 as,
Νῦη Ι &har Η mique αι’(ὶνέᾶφη.

It may, however, be also regarded as a Troehaic Dimeter Cataleetic, and
scanned as follows :

Νῡη ellasar neuque αῐινὲΙτῖνη ,

though, if we follow the authority of Terentianus, (De Metr. 738,) we
must consider the first appellation as the more correct one of the two, since
he expressly calls it by this name.

10. sffpmc.

This verse takes its name from the poetess Sappho, who invented it, and
cousists of five feet, viZ., a trochee, a spondeo, a dactyl, and two more
trochees; as,

Desinln stirps ἤρῑιεᾶτῆε 1 kambr,

But, iu the Greek stanza, Sappho sometimes makes the second foot a
trochee‚ in which she is imitated by Catullus ; as,

Παῒ ΔιΙῦς δόΙλοπλόκε, λίσσομα. τε.
Pauca Ι ηιῖηιῖιαίε meae puellae.

Horace, however, unifornily has the spondee in the second place, which
i·enders the verse much more melodious and flowing. The Sapphic stauza,
both in Greek and Latin, is composed of three Sapphics aud one Adonin.
(No. 4.) As the Adonie sometimes was irregularly subjoined to any in—
definite number of Sapphics, (vide Remarks on Adonic verse,) so, on
other occasions, the Sapphics were continued in uninterrupted succession,
terminating as they had begun, without the addition of an Adonin even at
the end, as in Boethius, lib. 2‚Vmetr. 6.—Seneca, Troades, act 4.

The most pleasing verses are those in which the caesui-al pause occurs at
the fifth half-font ; as

Ιηίέἷρέν villae} 11 ,ςεὲἶὲΙνίεᾳαὲ Ι ρῡνίἷε

N5n ἕξῃέε ΛΙαιῖΙνὶ ΙῙῘᾶοὕΙῐίε, melque ᾶνοῑί,

Nec υέἰηέηᾶΙιΞε ΙΙ ρνᾶυἷζάᾶ siilyittis,
Γῡεσὲ, ρῘιᾶΙνέἰφ-ᾶ.

The following lines, on the contrary, in which the pause falls differently,
are far less melodicus.
