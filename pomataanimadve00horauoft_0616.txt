57'2 Q. HORATII FLAccr

Dura sed emovere loco me tempora grato,
Civilisque rudem belli tulit aestus in arma,
Caesaris Augusti non responsura lacertis.
Unde simul primum me demisere Philippi,
Decisis humilem pennis, inopemque paterni 5⁰
Et laris et fundi, paupertas impulit audax
Ut versus facerem: sed, quod non desit, habentem
Quae poterunt unquam satis expurgare cicutae,
Ni melius dormire putem quam scribere versus?
Singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes 3 55

ples, and sepulchres, planted with losty plane-trees, and interseeted by
a gentle stream, it afforded a delightful retreat for philosophy and the
muses. Within this enclosure Plato possessed, as a part of his humble
patrimony, purchased at the price of three thousand drachmae, a small
garden, in which he opened a school for the reception of those who
might be inclined to attend his instructions. Hence the name Ac-a-
demy, given to the school of this philosopher, and which it retained
long after his decease.

47—5‘2. 47. Civilis aestus. “The tide of civil commotion.”-—48,
Caesaris Augusti non responsura lacertis. “Destined to prove an unequal
match for the strength of Augustus Caesar.''—49. Simul. For simul

closed the last struggle of Roman freedom, was a city of Thrace, built
by Philip of Macedon on the site of the old Thasian colony of Crenidae,
and in the vicinity of Mount Pangaeus, The valuable gold and silver
mines in its immediate neighbourhood rendered it a place of great
importance. Its ruins still retain the name of Fauna—50. Dec-isis
humilem pennis, inopemque, διο. “Brought low with clipped wingS, and
destitute of a paternal dwelling and estate ;” z'. e. and stripped of my
patrimony.—5l. Paupertas impulit medam, Sec. We must not understand
these words literally, as if Horace never wrote verses before the battle
of Philippi, but that he did not apply himself to poetry, as a profession,
before that time—52. Sed, quod non desit, habentem quae poterunt un-
quam satis empurgare cicutae, διο. “But what doses of hemlock will
ever sufficiently liberate me from my fremy, now that Ι have all which
is sufficient for my wants, if Ι do not think it better to rest than to
write verses ;'’ asse. but now, having a competency for all my wants, I
should be a perfect madman to abandon a life of tranquillity‚ and set up
again for a poet; and no hemlock would be able to expel my frenzy.
Commentators are puzzled to know how a poison, like hemlock, could
ever have been taken as a remedy. Taken in a large quantity it is
undoubtedly fatal, and it was employed in this way by the Athenians
for the purpose of despatching criminals, as the history of Socrates tes-
tifies ; but, when employed in small portions, it was found to be a useful
medicine. Horace speaks of it here as a frigorific-
