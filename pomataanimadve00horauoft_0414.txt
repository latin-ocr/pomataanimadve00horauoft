Putet aper rhombusque recens, mala copia quando

Atque acidas mavult inulas. Necdum omnis abacta

me11.”—chamquczm putet aper, ἃς. “ Though the boar and the fresh-
caught turbot are already nauseous, when surfeiting abundance provokes
the sickened stomach ; when, overloaded with dainties, it prefers rapes
and sharp elecampane.” Putet is here equivalent to nauseam creat, and
the oxymoron is worth noting between it and recens—Rhombus. Con-
sult note on Epode ii. 50.-43. Rapum. The rape is a plant of the
genus Brassica, called also cole-rape and cole-seed, and of which the
navew, or French turnip, is a variety.—44. Inulas. The elecampane
marks a genus of plants of many species The common elecampane has
a perennial, thick, branching root, of a strong odour, and is used in
medicine. Itis sometimes called yellow star-wort. Horace applies to
this herb the epithet acidas, not as the scholiast pretends, because it was
commonly preserved in vinegar, but from the sharp and pungent nature
of the plaut itselfi-—Necdwm omnis abacta, διο. “ Nor is every kind of
homely fare yet driven away from the banquets of the rich.” Rex· is
here used, as elsewhere in Horace, in the sense of beatior, ditior, δίο.-
46. Myris oleis. Columella (xii. 48.) recommends the dark-coloured
olives as the best for preserving.—-Haud ita pridem, διο. “ It is not so
long ago, that the table of Gallonius, the crier, was exclaimed against
by all for having a sturgeon served upon it ;'' i. e. was exclaimed against
by all, for this piece of extravagance in one of such contracted means.
This is the Gallonius whom Lucilius lashes in his satires, and whom, for
his gluttony, he calls yuryes. Compare Cicero, de Fin. ii. 8.-47.
Α cipensere. The sturgeon with us is far from being regarded as a deli-
cacy. In the time of Pliny it would seem to have been n'ewed as acom-
mon fish, and the naturalist expresses his surprise at the fallen fortunes
of this “ piscium apud antiquos nobilissimi.” So, in the present instance,
neither Horace nor Ofellus praises the sturgeon ε but they only allude to
the change of tastes in the case of this fish aud the tui-bot, the latter hav-
ing completely superseded the former.

48—50. 48. Quid? tum rhombos, ἃς. The meaning is, that the
turbot is now in as great repnte as the sturgeon was in the time of
Gallonius Did the sea then furnish no turbots Ρ Far from it; but no
fool had as yet brought them into fashion.—50. Donec vos auctor
docuit praetorius. ‘⁶ Until a man of praetorian rank first taught you to
eat these birds.'' The allusion is to a certain Asinius Sempronius
Rufus, who was the first that introduced young storks as an article of
food3 an addition to the luxuries of the table made in the reign of

Augustus. Horace, in givino Sempronius the appenation of praetorius,
