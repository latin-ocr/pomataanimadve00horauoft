Laudat rura sui : mox reficit rates

Quassas, indocilis pauperiem pati.

Est, qui nec veteriS pocula Massici,

Nec partem solido demere de die 2⁰
Spernit, nunc viridi membra sub arbuto

Stratus, nunc ad aquae lene caput sacrae.

—Metuens. “ As long as he dreads.”—Otz'um et oppidi, διο. “ Praises
a retired life, and the rural scenery around his native place.’'—18. Pau-
periem. “ The pressure of eontracted means.” Horace and the best Latin
writers understand by pauperies and paupertas, not absolute poverty,
which is properly expresscd by ,φθείρῃ but a state in which we are
deprived indeed of the comforts, and yet possess, in some degree, the neces-
saries of life—19. Massici. Of the Roman wines the best growths are
styled indiscriminately Massicum and Falernum (vinum). The Massic
wine derived its name from the vineyards of Mons Massicus, now Monte
Massico, near the ancient Sinuessa. The choicest wines were produced
on the southern declivities of the range of hills which commence in the
neighbourhood of Sinuessa, and extend for a considerable distance inland,
and which may have taken their general name from the town or district
of Falernus. But the most conspicuous, or the OE-st exposed among
them, seems to have been the Massic3 and asin process of time several
inferior growths were confounded under the common name of Falern-ian,
correct writers would choose that epithet which most accurately denoted the
fiQvintage. *-

20—21. 20. Partem solido, &c. Upon the increase of riehes, the
Romans deferred the cerwhich used to be their fflffldlay meal, to the
uinth bour (or three o’clock asternoon) in summer, and the tenthhour in

 

winter, taking ons—57⁶5 slight repast §prandium) at nooffiearly the
WhEl? of the natural day was therefore devoted to affairs of business, or
serious employment, and was called in consequence dies solidus. Hence
the voluptuary, who begins to quaff the old Massic before the accustomed
hour, is said ‘⁴ to take away a part from the solid day,'' or from the period
devoted to more active pursuits‚ and expend it on his pleasures. This
is what the poet, on another occasion, (Ode 11. vii. 6.) calls ‘⁴ breaking the
hugei-ing day m'th wine,'³ diem morantem frangere mera—21. Arbuto.
The arbutus (or arbatum) is the arbute, or wild strawberry-tree‚ corre-
sponding ‘so the κόμαρος of the Greeks, the unedo of Pliny, and the
Arburus unedo of Linnaeus, class 10. The fruit itself is called κόμαρον,
μεμαίκυλον, or μιμαίκυλον, (Athenaeus, ii. 35.) and in Latin arbatum.
‘It resembles our strawbcrry very closely, except that it is larger, and has
no seeds on the outside of the pulp like that fruit. The arbute tree
possesses medicinal qualities ε its bark‚ leaves, and fruit, are very astrin-
gent 3 and hence, according to Pliny, the origin of the Latin name unedo
(unus and edo), because but one berry could be eaten at a time. The
same writer describes the fruit as indigestible and unwholesome. Compare
Plin. Hist. Nat. xix. 24. and xxiii. 8 ; Fee, Flore de Virffle, p. 20;
Martyn‚ ad Viry. Geory. i. 148.

22—·28. 22. Sacrae. The fountain-heads of streams were supposed
to be the residence of the river-deity, and hence were always held sacred.
Fountains generally were sacred to the nymphe and rui-al divinities—
