One I.—C. Asinius Pollio, distinguished as a soldier, a pleader, and a
tragic author, was engaged in writing a history of the civil war. The poet
earnestly entreats him to persevere, and not to return to the paths of tragin
composition until he should have completed his promised narrative of Roman
affairs. The ode describes in glowing colours the expectations entertained
by the poet of the ability with which Pollio would treat so interesting and
difficult a subject.

For remarks on the character and writings of Pollio. compare-Daulop's
Roman Literatm‘e, vol. iii. p. 45. seqq. Lond. ed.

1-6. 1. Em Metello consule. “ From the consulship of Metellus.⁴·'
The narrative of Pollio, consequentiy, began with the formation of the first„
uiumviratm by Caesar„ Pompey, and Crassus, A. U. C. 694, in the consul-
ship of Q. Caecilius Metellus and L. Afranius. This may well be considered
as the germ of the civil wars that ensued. The Romans marked the year
by the names of the consuls, and he who had most sufflages, &c. was
placed first. The Atheniam, on the other hand, designated their years by
the narne of the chief archon, who was hence called “Ἀρχων Ἐπώνυμος.--
2. Bellique causas, &c. “ And of the causa, and the errors‚and the
operations, of the war.’' The term vitia has here a particular reference to
the rash and unwise plans of Pompey and his followers.—3. Luciumque
Fortunae. “ And of the gamo that Fortune played.''—Gravesque prin-
, vigum amicitias. “And of the fatal confederacies of the chiefs.’' An
allusion to the two triumviratcs. Of the first we have already spoken.
TheEQQnd was composed of Octavianus, Antony‚ and Lepidus. Compare
Lucan, ἰἾῖΙ.-5. Nondum ea'piatis. Compare Ode 1. ii. 29.-6.
Periculosae plenum, διε. “ An undertaking fullos danger and ofhazard.''
