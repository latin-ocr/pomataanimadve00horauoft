C'Izoros ducit. “Leads up the dances.”-Imminente Luna. “ Under
1110 full light of the moon.” The moon is here described as being directly
over head, and, by a beautiful poetic image, threatenz'ny, as it were,

arbitresses of all that is lovely and becoming, joined hand in hand with
the N)'mplis.’' We heve no single epithet in our language which fully

laborious forges of the Cyclops.’' The epithet ardens is here equivalent

thought to have imitated in this passage some Greek poet of Sicily, wh0‚
in depicting the approach of Spring, lays the scene in his native island,
with Mount Aetna sumking in the distant horizon. The interior of
the mountain is the sabled scene of Vulcan’s labours; and here he is
busily employed in forging thunderbolts for the monarch of the skies to
huri during the storms of Spring, which are of frequent occurrence 111 that
climate.

At the banquets and festive meetings of the ancients, the guests were
crowncd with gai-lauds of flowers, hcrbs, or leaves, ‘cied and adorned with
ribamls, or with the inner rind of the huden tree. These crowns, it was
thought, prevented intoxication.—Il1yrt0. The niyrtle was sacred to-
Venus—IO. Solutae. “ Freed from the fetters of winter.”—ll. F auno.
