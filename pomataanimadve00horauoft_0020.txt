XVl CHRONOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT, ETc.

This arrangement of Bentley's has received the decided commendation
of Gessncr, who remarks, ( Praes. ad Hor.) “ bed operae pretium est, h. e.
studiosis Horatii, qui Bentleianum exemplar ad manus non habent,
accommodatum, poni post hanc praefationem locum integrum ex praefa-
tione viri magni, quo tempora. librorum Horatii ordinat, de quo hoc certe
confirmare possum, me, dum recenseo singulas Eclogas, diligenter atten-
disse, si quid esset Bentleianis temporum rationibus adversum, nec depre-
hendisse quidquam, quod momentum aliquod ad eam evertendam haberet,
licet quibusdam Eclogis non improbabili ratione forte tempus etiam aliud,
recentius praesertim, possit adscribi. De Saecula1i Carmine suo loco satis
dictum, et laudatum ingenium Sanadoni. Possit aliquis drama velut quod-
dam non absimile contexere ex iis, quae in Canidiam scripta sunt, si
jungat Serm. 1. viii ; Epocl. V, xvii, xvii; denique Carm. 1. xvi. qui ipse
ordo ex argumento elucens pulchre Bentleiauam de temporibus hypothesin
confirmat.¹'

Vanderbourg, however, has not hesitatcd to attack this arrangement of
Bentley's, and, we think, in part at least, with good success. According
to this critic, it is absurd to suppose that a poet would write during some
years nothing but satires, during others nothing but odes, then epistles,
then odes again, &cu He ascribes Bentley’s mistake to his not having
distinguished between the time when a work is written, and when it is
given to the world. Vanderbourg thinks that the first two books of the
Odes contain pieces composed between the years 715 and 733, A. U. O.
He considers it impossible to refer their publication to an earlier period
than 733. Three odes, it is true, in the third book, are anterior to this
year; but Horace had his reasons for not placing them in the first or
second. This third book he makes to contain no ode whose date is subse-
quent to A. U. C. 735, whence we may reasonably conclude that it was
published in 735 or 736; the more too, as no ode of the fourth book
appears anterior to 736. All the odes whose dates are certain fall between
736 and 743. This latter collection, therefore, must have been published
either in 743, or shortly after, since Horace died in 746.

With regard to the Carmen Saeculare, no doubt can prevail in relation
to its date. The ancient scholiasts and Censorinus inform us that it was
sung at the saecular Games, celebrated by Augustus A. U. C. 737, when
Horace was in his 48th year.

As respects the Book of Epodes, Vanderbourg labours strenuously to
prove that it was not published during the lifetime of Horace, but consiste
of various fugitive pieces, written by the poet in his earlier years, and only
collected after his decease. His arguments rest in a great measure upon an
erroneous etymology of the term epode, which will be considered in a
subsequent part of the volume& In the meantime it will be sufficient to
state, that Bentley's theory, in relation to the date of the epodes, remains
completely unshaken.
