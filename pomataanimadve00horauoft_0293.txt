Io Triumphe! nec J ugurthino parem
Bello reportasti ducem,

Neque Africanum, cui super Carthaginem

addresses it as a god, and complains of its tardy approach. The idea
intended to be conveyed by the whole passage, from the present line to
the 261h‚ both inclusive, is simply as follows : When shall we celebrate
the triumph due to this most alonous victory, a triumph to be mnked
far before that of Marius over Jugurt'na, and that of Scipio for the orer-
throw of Carthage ?—Aureos currus‚· alluding to the triumpha} charior.y
which was wont to be adorned with gold and ivory.-22. Intactas
boves. The Roman triumphs always ended with a sacrifice to Jove:
and the victims, as in every other offering to the gods, were to be such as
had never felt the yoke. With intactas, therefore, we must understand

23—38. 23. Nec Juyurthino parem, &c. “ Thou didst neither
bring back a. leader equal to him from the war of Jugurtha, nor Africanus,
unto whom valour reared a monument upon the ruins of Carthage3” i. e.
Marius did not return with equal glory from the subjugation of Jugurtha,
nor the younger Africanus from the destruction of Carthago—22* Punico
luyubre mutavit sayum. ‘⁸ Has changed his purple robe for one of mouru-
ing.'' An hypallage for mutavit Punicum sayum luyubri sago. The
Roman sayum was properly a military robe: here, however, the term is
taken in a more extended sense3 the allusion in the text is to Antony, and
the epithet Punico may either refer simply to the colour of his paluda-
mentum, or general's robe, or else, what appears preferable, may contain
a general censure on the previous luxury and splendour of his :mire—29.
Aul ille centum nobilem, διε. This passage would seem to confirm the
truth of the remark made in a previous note, (v. l9‚) that no accurate
accounts had as yet reached the capital, either respecting the details of the
fight itself, or the ulterior movements of Antony.—30. Ventis non suis.
‘⁶ With unpropitious winds.⁷'—3l . Eaeercitatas Noto. “ Agitated by the
blast of the South.’' As regards the Syrtes, consult note on Ode 1. vii. 22.
-33. Capaciores offer huc, &m The joy of Horace was too lively, as
Dacier remarks, to wait the return of Maecenas. He celebrates the victory
tbe moment he receives the news ; and he thinks his apprehensions for the
safety of Octavianus ought now to cease, for it was not known at Romo
that he intended to complete his conquest by pursuing Antony, and exposing
himself to new dangers.-35. Fluentem nauseam. “ The rising qualm.”
