D
Sume I.—Our author, observing that many persons were irritated and
alarmed by the license of his satiric muse, states the case to his aged friend,
the lawyer Trebatius, who had been known as a professed wit in the age of
Cicero, and who humorously dissuades him from again ventur-ing on the
composition of Satires. The poet, however, resolves to persovere, and‚.in
pleading his cause, indulges in his natural disposition for satire and ridicule
with his wonted freedom.

1-8, 1. Et ultra leyem tendere opus. ‘⁶ And to push this speeies Δ

of writing beyond its proper limits.'' Leyem is here equivalent. in spirit
to normam or reyulam, and the simple verb tendere is employed by the
poet for the compound eoetendere. —2. Sine nervis. ‘without force. ”
-4. Deduci posse. Mig, ht be spun.' ” Βεάιιοί is a metaphorical
expres „sion taken from spinning wool, and drawing down the thread.—

end to thy satirical effusions..-6. Aio. The poet here very pleasantly
makes use of another expression pecuHar to the lawyers of the day.
