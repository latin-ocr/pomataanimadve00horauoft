athis expense.'' The expression equites peditesque is meant to com-
prehend the whole audience, as well the edueated and respectable, as
the uneducated and cmnmon portion. In applying thc term pedites to
the common people, the poet adopts a play-ful form of speech, horrowed
from military language, and marking a sportive opposition to the word
e untes.

The mercator rugus is one who has travelled much, has become ac-
quainted with the manners and customs of various nations, and who is
not only, in consequence of this, become inore refined in his own habits,
but also more shrewd, astute, and discerning. The cultor· riv-eneis agelli,

characters to labour upon, either such as arc. already known, or such as
areof their own invention. In the first they are not at liberty to
change any' thing 3 they must represent Achilles, Ajax, and Ulysses, in-
accordance with poetical tradition z and as, to what they invent them-›
selves, it >must be um‘form and of a picco. ‘

thou dost represent anew the honoured Achilles ;'’ i. e. dost represent

fatigabie, wrathful, inexorable, impctuous.'' Supply sit, and compare
the description given of this warrior in the Iliad. (20, 401.)-1·23. Sit

from Euripides, wiiere the unconquered fieroeness 'of this character
