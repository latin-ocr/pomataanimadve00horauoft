CARMINUM LIB. 11. 9. 101

Vexant inaequales procellae
Usque ; nec Armeniis in oris,

Amice Valgi, stat glacies iners 5
Menses per omnes ; aut Aquilonibus
Qucrceta Gargani laborant,
Et foliis viduantur orni.

ΟυΡ. IX.—Addrcssed to T. Valgius Rufus, inconsolable at the loss of his
son Mystes, who had been taken from him by an untimely death. The
bard counsels his friend to cease from his unavailing sorrow, and to sing
with him the praises of Augustus.

The individual to whom the ode is inscribed :vas himself a poet, and is
mentioned by Tibullus (iv. i. 180) in terms of high commendation :
‘¹ Valyt'us ,· aeterno propior non alter Homero.'' It is to the illusion
of friendship, most probably, that we must ascribe this lofty eulogium, since
Quintilian makes no mention whatever of the writer in question. Horace

1-7. l. Non semper, &c. The expressions, semper, usque, and
menses per omnes, in this and the succeeding stanza, convey a delicate
reproof of the incessant sorrow in which the bereaved parent so unavail-
ingiy indulges.—Hispidos in ayros. ‘⁴ On the rough fields.” The epithet
hispidus properly refers to the effect produced on the surface of the
ground by the action os the descending rains. It approximates herc very
closely to the term squalidus.——2. Aut mare Caspium. διε. “ Nor do
varying blasts continually disturb the Caspian Sea.’⁷ According to Malte-
Brun, the north and 'south winde, acquiring strength from the elevation
of the shores of the Caspian, added to the facility of their motion along
the sul-face of the water, exercise a powcrful influence in varying the level
at the opposite extremitics. Hence tho variatione have a range of from
four to eight feet, and powerful currents are generated both with the
rising and subsiding of the winds. (System of Geoyraphy, vol. ii. p.
313.)-4. Armeniis in oris. “ On the borders of Armenia.’' The
allusion is to the northern confines. Armenia forms a very elevated plain,
surrounded on all sides by lofty mountains, of which Ararat and Kohi-
selban are crowned with perpetual snow, The cold in the high districts of
the country ie so very intense as to leave only three months sor the season
of vegetation, including seed-time and harvest. Compare Malte-Brun,
system os Geoyraphy, vol. ii. p. 103.-7. Quereeta Garyani. “ The
oak groves of Garganus.” The chain of Mount Garganus, now Monte S.
Anyelo, runs along a part of the coast of Apulia, and finally terminates in

the Promontorium Garganum, now Punla di Viesta, forming a bold pro-
jection into the Adriatic.
