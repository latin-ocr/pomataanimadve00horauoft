378 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Vicinus, bene erat, non piscibus urbe petitis, 120
Sed pullo atque haedo .· tuin pensilis uva secundas
Et nux ornabat mensas cum duplice chu

Post hoc ludus erat, culpa potare mayistra :

Ac venerata Ceres, ita culmo suryeret alto,

Escplz'cuit vino contractae seria frontis. 125
Saeviat atque novos moveat fortuna tumultus ,-

Quantum liinc imminueb ,9 quanto aut eqo parcius, aut vos,
O pueri, niminis, ut huc novus incola venit ,9

Nam propriae telluris berum natura neque illum,

Nec ine, nec quemquam statuit .· nos expulit ille ; 130
Illum aut nequities aut vafri inscitia juris,

Postremum expellet certe vivacior lieres.

Nunc affer Umbreni sub nomine, nuper Ofelli

Dictus, erit nulli proprius, sed cedit in usum

directly opposed to the dies festi.-119. Operum vacuo per imbrem.
‘⁶ F reed from labour by the badness of the weather.”—l‘.20. Bene erat.
“ We had a pleasant time of it.'' We regaled ourselves.—l2l. Pensilis
uva. ‘⁶ The dried grape.” A species of raisin. The grapes here referred
to were hung up within doors to dry.—122. Duplice ficu. The
allusion is to ‘⁶ the split fig.” The sweetest figs, according to Aristotle,
were those that were spht, dried, and then pressed together again (δίχα
ἐσχισμέναι).-123. Post hoc ludus erat, culpa potare mayistra. “ After
this we amused ourselves with drinking, having the fine of a bumper as
the ruler of the feast.” The phrase culpa potare mayistra clearly alludes
to the custom prevalent at the entertainments of former days, and not
disused even in our own times, by which the individual who might
chance to offend against any of the rules of the feast was fined in one
cup, or in many, according to the extent of his offence. The nature of
his fault, therefore, would be the standard by which his amercement was
to be estimated.—124. Ac venerata Ceres, ita culmo, &cn ‘⁶ And Ceres
was worshipped, that the corn might thereupon rise in a losty stem.”
Venerata is here taken passively, and the allusion is to a libation poured
out in honour of the goddess.—-Ita; equivalent to venerata—Sumeret.
Understand ut.

128-134. 128. Nituistis. “ Have you sared ?” equimlent, by a
pleasing figure, to nutriti estis. Compare the remark of Doring: “nam
bene nutriti, praecipue rustici, nitent vultu et corpore.”— Ut. “ Since?

,-—Novus incola; alluding to Umbrenus—1¹29. Nam propriae telluris,
&Q “For nature has made neither him, nor me, nor any one else,
owner of a piece of land as a lasting possession.''—131. Nequities aut
vafri inscitia juris. “ An evil course of life, or a want of acquaintance
”with the subtleties of the law.”—l32. Vivacior heres. ‘⁶ His longer-
*lived heir.”—-134. Erit nulli proprius. ‘⁴ It will be a lasting possession

to no one.”
