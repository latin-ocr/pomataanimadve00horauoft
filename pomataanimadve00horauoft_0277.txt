shining Lares, the proof of a wealthy mansion. '' The epithet renidentes
is well explained by Doring: anis in foco accensi splendore resul-
yentesss '.—67 Haec ubi locutus, &c. “When the usurer Alphius had
uttered these words, on the point of becoming an inhabitant of the country,
he called in all his money on the Ides—on the Calends (of the ensuim r
month) he seeks again to lay it out!'' The usurer, convinced of the
superior felicity which a country life cau bestow, calls ln all his outstanding
capital, for the purpose of purchasing a farm· , but when the Calends of the
next mouth arrive, and bring with them the usual period for laying out
money at interest, his old habits of gain return, the picture which he has
just drawn fades rapidly from before his view, and the intended cultivator
of the soil becomes once more the usurer Alphius. Among the Romans
the Calends and Ides were the two periods of the mouth when money was
either laid out at interest, or called in. As the interest of money was
usually paid on the Calends, they are hence called tristes (Sermx. 111. 87),
and celeres (Ovid. de Rem. Amor. ii. 165); and a book m which the sums
demanded were marked, was termed Calendarium. (senec. Benefi' 1. 2.
and vii. 10. Id. Epist. xiv. 87.)

quence, he here wreaks his vengeance on the offending plant, describing it
ω a sufficient punishment for the blackest cn'meS, and as forming one of the
deadliest of poisons.
