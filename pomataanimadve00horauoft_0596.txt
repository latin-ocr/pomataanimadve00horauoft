552 Q,- HORATII FLACCI

Quod mecum ignorat, solus vult scire videri :

Ingeniis non ille favet plauditque sepultis,

Nostra sed impugnat, nos nostraque lividus odit.

Quod si tum Graiis novitas invisa fuisset, 90

There remain only a few words of the song of the Salii, which have
been cited by Varro. In the time of this writer, the car-men Saliare
was little, if at all, understood—87. Scire. “ To understand.'’—-88.
Inyeniis non ille favet, &c. The remark here made is perfectly just ;
for how can one, in reality, cherish an admiration for that, the tenor
and the meaning of which he is unable to comprehend Ρ

90—92. 90. Quod si tam Graiis novitas invisa fuisset, &c. The.
poet, having sufficiently exposed the unreasonable attachment of his
countrymen to the fame of the earlier writers, now turns to examine
the pernicious influence which it is likely to excit on the rising litera-
ture of his country. He commences by asking a pertinent question, to
which it concerned his antagonists to make a serious reply. They had
magnified (line ’28) the perfection of the Grecian models. But what
(from line 90 to 93) 'rf the Greeks had conceived the same aversion to
novelties as the Romans? How then could these models have ever
been furnished to the public use? The question, it will be perceived
insinuates what was before affirmed to bc the truth of the case-that
the unrivalled excellence of the Greek poets proceeded only from long
and vigorous exercise, and a painful uninterrupted application to the
arts of verse. The li’beral spirit of that people led them to countenance
ev ery new attempt towards superior literar) excellence· ; and so, by the
public favour, their writings, from rude essays, became at length the
standard and the admiration of succeeding times. The Romans had
treated their adventurers quite otherwise, and the effect was answer-
able. This is the purport of what to a common eye may look like a
digression (from line 93 to 108) 111 which are delineated the very dif-
ferent genius and practice of the two nations. For the Greeks (to line
102) had applied themselves, in the intervals of their leisure from the
toils of war, to the cultivation of literature and the elegant arts. The
activity of these restless spirits was incessantly attempting some new
and untried form of composition ς aud when that was brought to a due
degree of perfectiori, it turned in good time to the cultivation of some
other ; so that the very caprice of humour (line 101) assisted in this
country to advance and help forward the public taste. Such was the
effect of peace and opportunity with them. Hoc paces habuere bonae
ventique secundi. The Romans, on the other hand (to line 108), acting
under the influence of a colder temperament‚ had directed their prin·
cipal efforts to the pursuit of domestic utilities, and a more dexterous
management of the aits of gain. The consequence waS, that when
(to line 117) the old frugal spirit had in time deca 'ed and they
began to seek for the elegancies of life, a fit of versrfy 111σ the first of
all liberal amusements that usually seizes an idle people, came upon
them. But their ignorance of rules, and want ot exercise in the art of
writing‚ rendered thoem wholly unfit to succeed m it. The root of the
mischief was the idolatrous regard paid to their ancient poets, which
