³702 Q. IIORATII PLAcct

Si quid inexpertum scenae committis,¹ et audes 125
Personam formare novam, servetur ad imum

Qualis ab incepto processerit, et sibi constet.

Difficile est proprie communia dicere : tuque

Rectius Iliacum carmen diducis in actus,

Quam si proferres ignota indictaque primus. 130
Publica materies privati juris erit, si

Nec circa vilem patulumque moraberis orbem3

Nec verbum verbo curabis reddere fidus

Ixion be perfidious‚ Io wander, and Orestes mourn.”—-1·25. Si quid
inerpertum scenae committis. Having explained the fizmam sequere,
Horace now proceeds to elucidate the latter part of the line, aut sibi
convenientia finges—128. Difficile est proprie communia dicere. ‘⁵ It is
‹lifficult to handle common topics in such a way as to make them
appear our own property.'' Many commentators regard communia, in
this passage, as equivalent to ignota indictaque, and as indicating new
subjects, such namely as have never been handled by any previous
writer, and are therefore common to all. This, however, is decidedly
erroneouS. The meaning of this axiom of Horace should be explained
according to its most obvious sense 3 which is, as we have rendered the
passage above, that it is djfficult to enter on subjects which every man
can handle, in such a way as to make them appear our own property,
from the manner in which we alone are able to treat thern. Boileau
used to say that he found this explanation in Hermogenes, (de Gravit.
apt. dicend. ἓ 30,) and he laboured strenuously to support its correct-
ness. In the er‘tish Crine, vol. πε, p. 356, the opinion of Gaudjus, to
the same effect, is cited by Dr. Pana

129—131. 129. Rectius Iliacum carmen diducis in actus. The
poet has just stated how diffieult it ‘rs to handle a common subject in
such a way as to make it appear like a new one, and our own private
property. But, though he acknowledges the difficulty of the under-
taking, he by no means dissuades from it. On the contrary, he recom-
mends it as the more correct and. becoming course. Compare the
remark of Gaudius, cited in a part of the preceding note: ‘⁶ Difficile
est ita tractare communia . . . . ut tua propria, seu privata, seu nova
fiant. Hunc tamen ego conatum tibi suadeo.”—l3l. Publica materies
priuati juris erit. “A common theme will become thy private pro-
perty.'' The poet now proceeds to explain, in what way we must
act if we wish “proprie communia dicere.'’ The expression publica
materies serves directly to elucidate the true meaning of the term
communia in the 128th verse—Si nec circa vilem patulumque moraberis
orbem. ‘⁶ If thou shalt neither dwell upon a round of particulars, trite
in their nature and open unto all.’' The poet lays down three rules
for attaining the object in view, of which this is the first ; and the mean-
ing is, that, in handling a common topic, we must not spend our time
on the system or circle of subles in vogue among all poets iu relation
to it, hut must strike ont something new for ourselves.—l33. Nec ver-
‘mm verbo curabis reddere, ἃς. The second rule : Not to be translatura
