624 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Celsi praetereunt austera poemata Ques:
Omne tulit punctum, qui miscuit utile dulci,
Lectorem delectando pariterque monendo.
Hic meret aera liber §osiis7 hic et mare transit: 345
Et longum noto scriptori prorogat aevum.

Sunt delicta tamen, quibus ignovisse velimus.
Nam neque chorda sonum reddit, quem vult manus Εἰς mens,
Poscentique gravem persaepe remittit acutum3
Nec semper feriet quodcunque minabitur arcus. v ⁷350
Verum ubi plura nitent in carmine, non? ego paucis
Offendar maculis, quas aut incuriafudit, q
Aut humana parum cavit natura. ,Quidergo est ἓ ἡ
Ut scriptor si peccat idem librarius usque, , - ,
Quamvis est monitus, venia caret 3 ut citharoedus 355

347—359.. 347. Sunt delicta tamen, Sec. The bad poet is supposed
to object to the severity of the terms imposed by our author, and
to urge, that if the critic 1001 ed for all these requls sites, and exacted
them with rigour, it would be impossible to satisf'y hi'm: at least, it
was more likely to discourage than animate, as he proposed, th'e dili-
gence of writers. To this the reply is (from line 347 to 360), 'that it
was not intended to exact a faultless and perfect piece. that some
inaccuracies and faults ot less moment would escape the most cautious
and guarded writer3 and that as he, Horace, should condemn a piece
that was generally bad, notwithstanding a few beauties, he could, on
the other hand, admira a work that was generally good, notwithstand-
