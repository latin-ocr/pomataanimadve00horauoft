cises.—6. Curvae lyrae parentem. “Parent of the bending 'ures’
Mei-cury (Hymn. in Merc. 20. seqq.) 15 said, while still an infant,
to have formed the lyre from a toi-toisc which hc found in 1115 path,
stretching seven stn'ngs over the' hollow shcll (ἑπτὰ δὲ συμφώνους ὀΐων
ἐτανύσσατο χορδάς). Hence the epithets Ἐρμαῖη aud Κυλληναίη,
which arc. applied to this instrument, and hence 11150 the custoni of desig-
nating it by the ternis χέλυςἶ chelys, testudo, «Sto. Compare Gray, (Pro—
9ress of Poesy‚) ⁴‘ Enchanting shcll.” Another, and probably less accu-
rate account, makes this deity to have discovered on the banks of the
Nile, after the subsiding of an inundation‚ the shell of a tortoise with

nothing remaining of the body but the sinews: these, when touched, fixa,
emitted a musical sound‚ and gave Mercury the first hint of the lyre. ⁷

(Compare Germ. 233 Isidor. Oriy. iii. 4.) It is very apparent that the
fable, whatever the true vereion may be, has an astronomical meaning, and.
contains a reference to the seven planete, and to the pretended music of the
s heres. ⁷ ”
ρξῖ-ᾞΙῙ. 9. Te, boves olim nisi reddidisses, &c. “ thile Apono, in
former days, seeks with threatening accents to terrify thee, stilla inere
stripling‚ unless thou didst restore the cattle removed by thy art, he laughed
to find himself deprived also of his quiver.''-—Boves. The c‘ittle of Ad-
were fed by Apollo on the banks of the AmphrysuS‚ in Thessaly,
after that deity had been henighed for a time from the skics for destroying
the Cyclopes. Memnry, still a mere infant, drives off fift of- the herd,
and conceals them near the Alpheus, nor does he discover the place where
they are hidden until ordered so to do by his sire. (Hymn. in Merc- 70.
seqq.) Lucian (Dial. D. 7.) mentionswother sportive tliests of the same
deity, by‘which he deprived Neptiine of 1115 trident, Milite¹ of his sword,
Apollo of his bom Venus of her 0051115, and Jove himself of his sceptre.
“He would have stoleffth'e thunderbolt also, had it not been too heavy and
hot. (Εἰ δὲ μὴ βαρύτερος ὅ κεραυνὸς ἣν, καὶ πολὺ τὸ πῦρ εἶχε,
κᾶκεῖνον ἂν ὑφείλετο. Lucian, l. c.)-ll. Viduas-‚- a Graecism for
viduum se sentiens. Horace, probably following AlcaeuS‚blends together
two mythological events, which, according to other authorities, happened at
distinct periods. TheKHymn to Mercury merely speaks of the theft of the
cattle, after which Mercury gives the lyre as a peace-offeling ‘to Apollo.
The only allusion to the arrows of the god is where Apollo, after this, ex-
presses his sear lest the son of Maia may deprive him both of these weapons
and of the lyre itself.
