236 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Non me Lucrina juverint conchylia,
Magisve rhombus, aut scari, 50
Si quos Eois intonata fluctibus
Hiems ad hoc vertat mare ,-
Non Afra avis descendat in ventrem meum,
Non attagen Ionicus
J ucundior, quam lecta de pinguissimis 55
Oliva ramis arborum,
Aut herba lapathi prata amantis, et gravi
Malvae salubres corpori,
Vel agna festis caesa Terminalibus,
Vel haedus ereptus lupo. 60
Has inter epulas, ut juvat pastas oves
Videre properantes domum !
Videre fessos vomerem inversum boves

Collo trahentes languido !

49—54. 49. Lucrina conchylia. “The Lucrine shell-fish.'’ The
Lucrine lake was celebrated for oysters and other shell-fish.— 50.
Rhombus. “The turbot.'’-—Scari. The Scarus (“ Sem-‚⁸¹ or ‘⁶ Char ''
was held in high estimation by the-ancients. Pliny (Hist. Nat. ix. 173
remarks of it, that it is the only fish which ruminates: an observation
which had been made by Aristotle before him; and hence, according to
this latter writer, the name μήρυξ given to it by the Greeks. The
aneients, however, were mistaken on this point, and Buffon has corrected
their error. The roasted Scarus was a favourite dish, (compare Athenaeus,
7. ed. Schweiyh. vol. iii. p. l75‚) and the liver of it was particularly
commended-51. Si quos Eois, διο. “ If a tempest, thundered forth
over the eastern waves, turn any of their number to this sea.''—Asra
avis. “The Guinea-fowl.” Some commentators suppose the turkey to
be here meant, but emoneously, since this bird was entirely unknown to
the ancients. Its native country is America. On the other hand, the
Guinea-fowl (Numida Meleayris) was a bird well known to the Greeks
and Romans.—-54. Attayen Ionicus. “ The Ionian attagen :” a species,
probably, of heath-coek. Alexander the Myndian (Athenaeus, ix. 39.
vol. iii. p. 431. ed. Schweiyh.) describes it as being a little lai-ger than a
partridge, having its back marked with numerous spots, in eolour ap-
proaching that of a tile, though somewhat more reddish. Mr. VValpole
thinks it is the same with the Tetrao Francolinus. (Walpole's Collect.
vol. i. p. 262. in ‘noti-r.)

57—67. 57. Herba lapathi. The lapathum, a speeies of sorrel,
takes its name (λάπαθον) fromits medicinal properties. (λαπάζω, purgo.)
-58. Maleae. Compare note on Ode 1. xxxi. 16.-59. Terminalibus.
The Terminalia, or festival of Terminus, the god of boundaries, were
celebrated on the 23d of February. (7211 day before the Calends of
March.)·—60. Haedus ereptus lupo. Compare the explanation of Gess-
ner: ‘⁶ Ad frugalitatem rusticam refertur. Non mactaturus paterfami-
