EPISTOLARL’M LIB. 1. 3. 46⁷

Thracane vos, Hebrusque nivali compede vinctus,

An fieta vicinas inter currentia turres,

An pingues Asiae campi collesque morantur 2 5
Quid studiosa cohors operum struit? Hoc quoque cure.
Quis sibi res gestas Augusti scribere sumit?

Bella quis et paces longum diffundit in aevum?

Quid Titius, Romana brevi venturus in ora,

Pindarici fontis qui non expalluit haustus, lo
Fastidire lacus et rivos ausus apertos ἓ .

Ut valet? ut meminit nostri? fidibusne Latinis

Thebanos aptare modos studet, auspice Musa ’ἓ

1-3, 1.ι Juli F [ore. This is the same nith the one to whom the
second epistle of the second book is inscribed. He is there called the
faithful friend of Nero ; whence it has bcen conjectured that he was a
person of consideration at court—2. Claudius Augusti privignus. ΤῙἾΘ
reference is to Tiberius Claudius Nero, son of Tiberius Nero and Livia.
He is here styled “the step-son of Augustus‚’' from his mother’s having
married that emperor. The expedition on which the prince was sent
has been already alluded to in the Introductory Rcmarks. As the cx-
pedition to which we are referring was made with great dispateh, it was
sometimes not exactly known a: Rome where the army was· Hence
the questions put by the poet.—3. Thracane. As regards the Greek
form Thraca, here employed for Thracia, compare the remark of the
scholiast: “Graece protulit Θρήκη pro Thracia.'' Tiberius directed his
course through Macedonia into Thrace-Hebrusque nivali compede
vinctus. The expedition was made in the winter scason. As regards
the Hebrus itself, consult note on Ode 111. xxv. 10.—4. Anfretq vicinas
inter currentia turres. A description of the IIellespont.—5. Maroneum
equivalent to detinent.

6—14. 6. Studiosa cohors. ‘⁶ The studious train.” The young
Romans who attended Tiberius in this expedition, at once to form his
court and to guard his person, were men of letters and genius ; whence
they are here styled studiosa cohors. To the number of these belonged
Titius, Celsus, and Munatius, mentioned in the course of the epistle.—-
Operum. Governed by quid, and alluding to the literary labours of the
individuals composing the studiosa cohors—8. Bella quis et paces Ion-
gum deffundit in aevum? ⁴· Who transmits his wars and treaties of
peace to distant ages ?'' i. e. the martial and peaceful glories of his
reign.—9. Titius. The same with the Titius Septimius to whom the
sixth ode of the second book is inscribed. This individua] appears to
have been a young man devoted to poetical studies, and who intended in
a short time to publish his works. ζ Romana brevi venturus in erra.)—
10. Pindarici fontis qui non expalluit haustus, δίο. “ Who, having
dared to contemn the lakes and streams open to the use of all, has not
fem-ed to drink of the Pindaric spring ;'' i. e. who has separated himself
from the herd of common poetS, and, aiming at higher efforts, has
