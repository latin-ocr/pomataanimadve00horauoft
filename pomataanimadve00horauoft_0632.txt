5853 Q. HOR ATII FLACCI

pretending poets of his age. Such, however, it is conceived, does not
appear to have been his primary object, which would, in some degree,
have been in contradiction to the scope of his epistle to Augustus.
(Dunlop's Roman Literature, vol. iii. p. ι270. seqq.) The same remark
will apply to the theory of Ast, which is in effect identical with that of
Sanadon and Engel. Ast supposes that Horace, in composing this
epistle, had in view the Phaedrus of Plato, and, that as in the Greek
dialog-ue the philosopher ridiculcs the rhetoricum, so Horace wishes
to indulge his raillery at the worthless poets of his time. Do'ring
maimanis, that the object οἵ Horace, in the present piece, is to guard
against the peruicious influence of the bad pocts of the day, and that
he therefore gives a collection os precepts, unconnected, it is true, yet
having all a direct beaiing on the object at which he aims, and de-
scribing, as wcll the excellencie-s in composition that should be sought
after, as the errors and (lcfects that ought to be carefully avoided.
Finelly, De Bosch‚ in his notes to the Greek Anthology, supposes
that thc. poem was not actually addressed to any of the Pisos, but that
the poet made use of this name by way of prosopopoeia.

We have already remarlred, that the¹ theory of &Vieland has sup*-
planted llurd’s, and, as we have given an outline of the latter, it may
not be amiss to subjoin a slight sketch of the formem the more espe-
cially as we intend to follow it in our Explanatory Notes on this piece.
We will use the words of Colman: “ The poet begins with general
reflections addressed to his three friends. ln these preliminary rules,
equally necessary to be observed by poets of every denomination, he
dwells ou the importance of unity of design, the danger of being
dazzled by the splendour of partial bcaudes, the choice of subjects,
the beauty of order, the elegance and propriety of diction, and the use
ofa thorough knowledge of the nature of the several different species
of poetry3 summinq up this introductory portion of his epistle in a
manner perfectly agree-able to the conclusion of it.

‘ Descriptus servare vices rsperumque colores,
Cur ego, si nequeo ignoroque, pocta salutar?
Cur nescire, pudens prave, qnam discere malo ?’ ''

From this general view of poetrv, on the canvas of Aristone, but en-
tirely after his own manner. the writer proceeds to give the rules and
the history of the drama, adverting principally to Tragedy,with all its
constituente and appendages of diction, fable, character, incideuts‚
chorus, measure, music, and decorations. ln this part of the work,
according to the interpretation of the best critics‚ and indeed, Ι think,
according to the manifest tenor of the Epistle, he addresses himself
entirely to the two young Pisos, pointing out to them the difficulty, as
well as the excellence, of the dramatic art3 insisting on the avowed
superiority of the Greciun writers, and ascribing the comparative failure
of the Romans to negligence and the love of gain. The poet, having
exhausted this part of his subject, suddenly drops a second, or
dismisses at once no less than two of the three persons to whom he
originally addressed his Epistle, and, turning short on the elder Piso,
most earnestly conjures him to ponder on the danger of precipitato
