288 Q.. HORATII FLACCI

Denique sit finis quaerendi3 quoque habeas plus,
Pauperiem metuas minus, et finire laborem
Incipias, parto quod avebas. Ne facias, quod
Ummidius, qui, tam (non longa est fabula) dives, 95
Ut metiretur nummos ; ita sordidus, ut se
Non unquam servo melius vestiret 3 ad usque
Supremum tempus, ne se penuria victus
Opprimeret, metuebat. At hunc liberta securi

Divisit medium, fortissima Tyndaridarum. 100
Quid mi iyitar suades ? ut vivam Maenius aut sio

Ut AVomentanas ,9 Pergis pugnantia secum

Frontibus adversis componere? Non ego, avarum

Quum veto te fieri, vappam jubeo ac nebulonem.

Est inter Tanain quiddam socerumque Viselli ε 105

Est modus in rebus, sunt certi denique fines,

-90. Infelix. The vocativa—94. Pareo quod avebas. “ What thou
didst desire being now obtained.” Understaud (zm—95. Qui, tam, δίο.
“ Who (the story is not long) so rich that* he measured his money.''——97.
Ad usque supremum tempus. “ To the very last moment of his life.’'
—100. Fortissima Tyndaridarum. “ Bravest of the children of Tyn-
darus‚” i. e. a second Clytemnestra. The poet likens the freedwoman to
Clytemnestra, who slew her husband Agamemnon, and in so doing proved
herself, as he ironically expresses it, the bravest of the Tyndaridae. This
term, Tyndaridae, though of the masculine gender, includes the children
of Tyndarus of both sexes.

101—106. 101. Quid ‘mi iyitur suades? διο. “What then dost
thou advise me to do} To live like Maenius, or in the way that Nomen-
tanus does ἓ ” Maenius and Nomentanus appear to have been two dissi-
pated prodigals of the day; and the miser, in whose eyes any, even
the most trifling, expendsture, seems chargeable with extmvagance, ima-
gines, with charoeteristic spirit, that the poet wishes him to turn spend-
thrift at once.--102. Peryis pugnantia secum, &c. We have here
the poet's reply: “ Art thou going to unite things that are plainly repug-
nant 3 '³ lsterally, “things that contend together with opposing fronts.'’

A metaphor taken from the eombats of anmals, particularly of rams.—- ·

do not order thee to become a spendthrift and a prodigal.'⁷ Vappa pro-
perly deuotes. palled or insipid wine z it is thence figuratively applied to
one whose extravagance and debaucheries have rendered him good for
nothing. The om'gdu of the torm nebulo is disputem—105. Est inter
Tanain quiddam, &c. “ There is some difference certainly between
Tanais and the father-in-law of VisellusJ‘ The poet offers the example
of two men, as much uniike as the miser is to the prodigal. Compare
the remark of Db'ring: ‘⁶ Tanais, Maecenatis libertus, spado, at socer
quidam Viselli herniosus fuisse dicitur. Multum inter se differebant
iyitur ⁴sti duo homines.”—106, Est modas in rebus, διο. “ There is a
