were, on every side, and in a state of equilibrium.

[rr-iguo m'hil est elutius horto. ‘⁶ Nothing is more insipid than the pro-
duce of a much-watered garden.‘' This whole precept is denied by the
commentatms to be true, and they cite, in opposition to it, the remark
of Palladius, iii. ⁶24. Catius, however, may after all be right, if he
means to contrast merely the productions of the fields, matured in due
season, with the forced offspring of the gaulone—18. Ne gallina ma-
lum responset, ἃς. “ In order that the hen served up to him may not
prove tough, and badly answer the expectations of his palate.'’ The
hen which is killed on the sudden arrival of a guest, and immediately
thereaster cooked, will prove, according to Catius, tough and unplea-
sant. To remedy this evil, the fowl should be plunged, before it is
killed, in Falernian must.—·20. Protensibus optima fungis, Sec. Con-
noisseurs declare that this precept is false, and that the best mush-
xooms‚ generally speaking, are those gathered in woods and on heaths or
downs. These, they maintain, are more-wholesome, and better fla-
voured, than those of meadows.—·2·2. Qui nigris prandia moris finiet.
Another false precept. Mulberries should be eaten before, not after
dinner. Compare Pliny. ( Hist. Nat. xxiii. 70.)—·2⁹. Ante gravem quae
legerit, &a The juices of tenderet fruit, observes Francis, evaporate by
the heat of the sun, but are collected and confined by the coldness of the
night. On the contrary, hardcr and firmer fruit, such as appleS, should
be gathered in the middle of the day, when the sun has ripened and con-
oocted their juices.

24—32. 24. Aufidius forti miscebat, ἃς. Aufidius, an epicure, is
here blamed 101· having introduced a kind of mulsum, or mend, composed
of honey and strong Falernian wine. The precept lajd down by Catius
goes to recommend a milder draught. The mulsum of the Romans was
either taken early in the morning, in order to fortify the stomach and
