488 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Excusare laborem et mercenaria vincla,

Quod non mane domum venisset; denique, quod non
Providisset eum.—Sz‘c iqnovisse putato

Me tibi, si coenas hodie mecum— Ut libet—Enyo 7⁰
Post nonam venies ,· num: i, rem strenuus ωερε.

Ut ventum ad coenam est, dicenda tacenda locutus,
Tandem dormitum dimittitur. Hic, ubi saepe

Occultum visus decurrere piscis ad hamum,

Mane cliens et jam certus conviva, jubetur 7⁵
Rura suburbana indictis comes ire Latinis.

Impositus mannis arvum coelumque Sabinum

Non cessat laudare. Videt ridetque Philippus,

Et sibi dum requiem, dum risus undique quaerit,

Dum septem donat sestertia, mutua septem ae
Promittst, persuadet, uti mercetur agellum.

Mereatur. Ne te longis ambagibus ultra

Quam satis est morer, ex nitido fit rusticus, atque

employment as praeco, and his labouring in it for regular hire—68.
Quod non mane domum venisset. Clients and others waited upon dis-
tinguished men early in the morning, for the purpose of paying their

“Whatever came into his head ;'' literally‚ things to be mentioned, and
things about which silence should have been kept. The poet evidently
intends this as an allusion to the effects of Philip’s good old wine upon
his new est.

client, and now a constant guest, is deshed, on the proclaiming of the
Latin holidays, to accompany Philip to his country-seat near the oity.’'
-75. Mane cliens. Compare note on verse 68.-—76. Indictis. *Un-
derstand α consule. The Feriae Latinae, or Latin hohdays, were first
appointed by Tarquin for one day, but after the expulsion of the kings
they were continued for two, then for three, and at last for four days.
They were kept with great solemnity on the Alban mountain. The
epithet indictae marks them as movable, and appointed at the pleasure.
of the consul, a circumstance which places them in direct opposition to
the Statae Feriae, or fixed festivals of the Romans. Philip could go into
the country during these holidays, as the courts were then shut.—79.
Et sibi dum requiem, διο. “And while he seeks diversion for himself,
while he endeavours to draw amusement from every thing.''-80. Mutua
