SERMONUM ΜΒ. 11. 6. Δ121

Hercule! Si, quod adest, gratum juvat: hac prece tc oro,
Pingue pecus domino facias et cetera praeter
Ingenium3 utque soles, custos mihi maximus adsis. 15
Ergo ubi me in montes et in arcem ex Urbe removi,
(Quid prius illustrem Satiris Musaque pedestri ’.3)
N cc mala me ambitio perdit, nec plumbeus Auster,
Auctumnusque gravis, Libitinae quaestus acerbae.
Matutine pater, seu June libentius audis, 20
Unde homines operum primos vitaeque labores
Instituunt‚ (sic dis placitum,) tu carminis esto
Principium. Romae sponsorem me rapis—Eia,

13-19. 13. δι’, quod adest, yratum juvat. “ 1f what Ι at present
have pleases and makes me grateful.”—l4. Et cetera praeter inyenium.
The poet prays to have every thing fat except his understanding. We
have here a play on the double meaning of pinyue, which, when applied
to inyenium denotes an understanding that is heaxy and duxi—16. In
arcem. The poet regards his country-house as a citadel inaccessible to
the cares and annoyances that besieged him at Rome.—l7. Quid prius
illustrem Satiris M usuque pedestri :² The effect of this parenthesis
is extremely pleasing : no sooner is allusion made to his escape from the
noise and crowd of the capital, than the poet, struck with the idea of the
pure enjoyment that awaits him amid the peaceful scenery of his Sabine
vale, breaks forth into the exclamation: ‘⁶ What can I rather celebrate
in my Satires and with my piosaic Muse ?'’ i. e. what rather than the
pleasures of this retirement can I celebrate in the prosaic verse of my
satiric productioris ,2—Musaque pedestri. Compare the Greek form of
expression πεζὸς λόγος to indicate“ prose, and note on Ode 11. xii. 9.
—18.Plumbeus.'17his epithet well expresses the influence produced
on the human frame by the wind alludcd to in rendering it heavy and
inert. The poets retreat was covered by rhountains, in such a man-
ner, that he had nothing to sear from its bad effecta—19. Auctumnus-
que yravis. “ And the sickly autumn.” The season when the wind
just mentioned prevails.—Lz'bz'tinae quaestus acerbae. ‘⁶ The gain of the
baleful Libitina. '' The allusion is to the numerous deaths in the sickly
period of autumn, and the gain accruing therefrom to the temple of
Libitina, the goddess of funeral 5, where ean things requisite for inter-
ments were either sold or hired out. ι

20—27. 20. Alatutine pater. “Father of the morning? The
poet, intending to describe the employmcnts and bustle of the capital,
imitates the custom of the epic irritem, and, as they commence their
labours with the 1111 ocation of some Muse, so here he begins with an
addi-ess to Janus, the god to whom not only the opening of the year
was consecrated, but 3150 that of the day. —Seu «lane libentius audis.

“Or if with more pleasure thou hearest the appellation of ‹Ianusst'
Jane' is here taken materially, as occurring in the language of invoca-
tions. Many commentators, 11011 cx er, prefer giving audis at once, like
the Greek· ακούεις, the meaning of iiiceris or appellaris. -21. Unde.
