SERMONUM Lm. ΙΙ. 3 :593

Rex surm—Nil ultra quaero plebeius—Et aequam

Rem imperito ,· at, si ceci cidem· ozon justas, inulto

Dicere, quod sentit, perminoff—Maxime regum, 19ss
Di tibi dent capta classem reducere Troja.

Ergo consulere et mox respondere licebit ἲ-
Consule-Cur Ajax‚ heros ab Achille secundus,

Putescit, toties servatis clarus Achivis?

Gaudeat ut populus Priami Priamusque inhumato, 195
Per quem tot juvenes patrio caruere sepulcro ’.ἲ-

Mille ovium insanas morti dedit, inclytum Ulia-en

Et Menelaum una mecum se occidere clamans.—

Tu quum pro vitula statuis dulcem Aulide natam

Ante aras, spargisque mola caput, improbe, salsa, ‘200
Rectum animi servas? Quorsum insanus? Quid enim Ajax
Fecit? Quum stravit ferro pecus, abstinuit vim

Agamemnon. The interrogator then proceeds to show, in repl) to this
defence on the part of the Grecian king ,that the latter was far more

insane himself, when he gave up his daugghter Iphigenia to the knife ot ἰ
the sacrificer.—188. Rex sum. “I am a king ;'' i. e. I do this ot my
own royal pleasure‚ and no one has a right to inquire into the motives of
my eonduct.-——Et aequam ‘rem imperito. The humility of his opponent,
in seeming to allow his royal manner of deeiding the question, now
extorts a second and more condescending reply from the moriar-cll.-
199. Inulto. “ With impunity.'’-—l9l. Di tibi dent, &c. Compare
Homer, Il. i. 18.

192—206. 192. Consulere. ‘⁶ To ask questions.’¹ Both consulo and
respondeo, as used in the present passage, are terms borrowed from the
practice of the Roman ban—195. Gaudeat ut populus Priami, ἃς. Corn-
pare Homer, [lsi. 255, ἦ κεν γηθήσαι Πρίαμος, Πριάμοιό τε παῖδες.
-197, ᾸΙῑΙίε ovium insanus, &a In this and the following line we
have the reply of Agamemnon, but almost the very first word he utters
(insanus) excuses in fact Ajax, and condemns himself. A man, as
Sanadon remarks, who revenges himself upon the corpse of an insane
person, must be more insane himself than the individual was who injured
him-199. Natam. Iphigenia—Aulide. Aulis, on the coast of Boeotia,
“and almost opposite Chalcis in Euboea, is celebrated in history as the
rendezvous of the Grecian fleet, when about to sail for Troy—⁸200. Im-
probe. ‘⁶ Wieked man. “'—*201. Rectum animi. “ Thy right mind. '’—
Quorsum insanus. ² W hy' is the hero st) led by thee insane? '’ The
interrogator demands of th'e mon irch wh) he called Ajax' insane when
speaking of him 1n relation to the affair of the sheep. Compare verse
197. Quorsum 1s here equivalcnt to the simple cur, an usage of frequent
occurrence in Cicera—⁸203. Uaeore et ynam. Tecmessa and Eur}-
nucem—Mala multa precatus Α treviis. ‘⁶ Though he uttcrcd many
