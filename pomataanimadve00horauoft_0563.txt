Omnis Aristippum decuit color et status et res,

therefore, is used in speaking of those who fare sumptuously, while by
sicci are meant such as are confined, from scanty resources, to a spate
and frugal diet.

13-2-2. 13. Si pranderet olus patienter, (Sto. “If he could dine
contentedly on herbs, Aristippus would not feel inclined to seek the
society of kings.'' Horace, after laying it down as a maxim that every
one ought to live according to his taste and liking, suddenly introduces
Diogenes, the well-known founder of the Cynic sect, opposing this
decision, and condemning every species of indulgence.—l4. Si sciret
regibus uti, &a The reply of Aristippus. —15. Qui me notat. “ He
who censures my conduct ;” alluding to Diogenes.—18. Mordacem
Cynicum sic eludebat. “ He thus baffled the snarling Cynic ;'' ι’. e. he
thus avoided the Cym'c'stooth.—19. Scurror eyo ipse mihi, populo tu.
‘⁶ Ι play the buffoon for my own advantage, thou to please the populace.”
AristippuS, observes Sanadon, does not in fact aeknowledge he was a
buffoon, but rather makes use of the term to insuit Diogenes, and dex-
terously puts other words of more civil import in the place of it when he
again speaks of himself. (Officium facio.) My buffoonery, says he‚if
it daeerves the name, procures me profit and honour ; thine leaves thee
in meanness, indigence, filth, and contempt. My dependence is on
kings, to whom we are born in subjection ς thou art a slave to the peo-
ple, whom a wise man should despise.—Hoc. “ This line of conduct
that Ι Ρωιιθ.”-”Ἰ1. Officium facio. “ I do but my duty.'' Aristippus,
remarks Dacia, pays his court to Dionysius without making any
request. Diogenes, on the other hand, asks even the vilest of things
(vilia rerum) from the vilest of people. He would excuse himself by
saying, that he asks, only because what he·aSkS is of little value ; but if
the person who receives an obligation is inferior at that time to the per-
son who bestows it, he is inferior in proportion to the meanness of the
favour he receives—2¹2. Quamvis fers te nullius egentem. “Though
thou pretendest to be in want of nothing. '⁹

23-25. 23. Omnis Aristippum decuit color, διο. “Every com-
plexion, and situation, and circumstance of life, suited Aristippus.''
Aristippus possessed a versatility of disposition, and politeness of man-
ners,which‚ while they enabled him to accommodate himself ἰο every
situation, eminently qualified him for the easy gaiety of a court. Per-
fectly free from the reserve and haughtiness of the preceptorial chair, he
