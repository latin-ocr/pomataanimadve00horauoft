180 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Rara decurrens lupa Lanuvino,
F etaque vulpes ε

Rumpat et serpens iter institutum, 5
Si per obliquum similis sagittae
Terruit mannos—Ego cui timebo,

Providus auspex,

Antequam stantes repetat paludes
Imbrium divina avis imminentum, 10

Oscinem corvum prece suscitabo
Solis ab ortu.

Sis licet felix, ubicunque-mavis,

At memor nostri, Galatea, vivas :

Teque nec laevus vetet ire picus, 15
N ec vaga cornix.

Ona XXVII.—Addressed to Galatea, whom the poet seeks to dissuadet-³
from a. voyage which she intended to make during the stormy season of the
year. The train of ideas is as follows: “ I will not seek to deter thee
from the journey on which thou art about to enter, by rccounting evil
omens 3 I will rather pray to the gods that no danger may come nigh thee,
and that thou mayest set out under the most favourable auspices; yet,
Galatea, though the auguries forbid not thy departure, think, I entreat‚ of
the many perils which at this particular season are brooding over the deep.
Beware lest the mild aspectos the deceitful skies lead thee astray, and
lest, like Europa, thou become the victim of thy own imprudeneess'g The

poet then dwells upon the story of Europa, and with this the ode ter-
minates.

1—15. 1. Impios parrae, διο. “ May the ill-omened cry of the
noisy screech-owl accompany the wicked on their way.” The leading
idea in the first three stanzas is as follows: Let evil omens accompany
the wicked alone, and may those that attend the departure of her for
whose safety I am solicitous‚ be favourable and happy oues.—2. Ay‘ro
Lanuvino. Lanuvium was situate to the right of the Appian Way, on
a hill commanding an extensive prospect towards Antium and the sea.
As the Appian XVay was the direct route to the port of Brundisium, the
animal mentioned in the text would cross the path of those who travelled
in that direction.—5. Rumpat et serpens, διο. “ Let a serpent also
interrupt the journey just begun, if, darting like an arrow athwart the
way, it has terrified the horses.”—7. Mannus means properlya small
horse, or nag, and is thought to be ast-{rm of'y Gallie origiQ÷Eyo cui
timebo, διε. The construction is as follows ε Providus auspeae, suscitabo
prece illi, cui eyo timebo, oscinem corvum ab ortu solis, antequam avis
divina imminentum imbrium repetat stantes paludes. ‘⁶ A provident
augur, I will call forth by prayer, on account of her for whose safety
Ι feel anxious, the croaking raven from the eastern heavens, before the
bird that presages approaching rains shall revisit the standing pools.”
