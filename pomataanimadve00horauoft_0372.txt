33¹2 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Quo pueri magnis e centurionibus orti,

Laevo suspensi loculos tabulamque lacerto,

Ibant octonis referentes Idibus aera ‚

Sed puerum est ausus Romam portare, docendum
Artes, quas doceat quivis eques atque senator
Semet prognatos. Vestem servosque sequentes,
In magno ut, populo, si qui vidisset, avita

Ex re praeberi sumtus mihi crederet illos. ΒΟ

epithets mayni and maym‘s as applied to the sons of these centurions and
their parents. The poor parent of the bard sends his humble offspring
to Rome, the yreat centurione send their yreat sons to the mean and
petty school of the provincial pedagogum—74. Laevo suspensi loculos,
&a “With their bags of counters and their ciphering tables hanging
on the left arm.⁷' The term tabula is here applied to the table for
reckoning and for performing various operations in arithmetic, used by
the Roman boys and others. The computations were carried on, for
the most part, by means of counters; sometimes, as with us, characters
were employed. In the latter case, the table was covered with saud or
dust. The more common name is abacus.—75. Octonis referentes
Idibus aera. ‘⁸ Bringing with them, from home, calculatione of interest,
for a given sum, to the day of the Ides.'’ These are sums, as we would
call them, which the boys receive from their master to take home and
work there ς the answers they are to bring with them to school the next
morning. The sums given are computations of interest: to ascertain,
for example, how much a certain amount will yield within a certain
time, and at a certain rate of interest. The period up to which they
are to calculate is fixed‚ it will be perceived, for the Ides of the ensuing
month3 in other words, the calculations on which they are employed
have reference to monthly rates of interest. This was in accordance
with Roman usage, by which the interest of money was paid either on
the Calends or the Ides of every mouth. As regards the epithet octonis,
it may be remarked, that it is here applied to the Ides. because in every
month eight days intervened between the Noues and them. As our lan-
guage affords no corresponding epithet, we have regarded it, with the
best commentators‚ as merely expletive, and have left it, in consequence,
untranslated.

76-81. 76. Est ausus. The allusion is to the boldness of his
parent in giving him an educadon, the expense of which could have but.
ill accorded with his narrow finances.——·77. Artes. ‘⁴ Accomplishments.’'
—Doceat. ‘⁶ causes to be taught.'’ Equivalent to docendas curet.—
79.1n mayno ut populo. “ Although in the midst of a crowded popu-
lace.'’ Amid the crowd ofa large city, little attention is comparatively
paid to the appearance of others. The poet, however, states that, so
imposing was the attire and revenue which liis good father gave him, as
to excite attention even amid the dense population that crowded the
streete of the Roman capita1.—Avita ez· re. “ From some hereditary
estaoe.'’ The poet means, that he appeared to the view of men, not as
the son ofa freedman, but as if he had been the heir of some wealthy
family.—-80. Illos. Equivalent to tam magmas-81. Ipse mihi custos,
