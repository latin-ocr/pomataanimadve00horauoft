626 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Ut gratas inter mensas symphonia discors

Et crassum unguentum, et §ardo cum melle papaver 375
Offendunt, poterat duci quia coena sine istis:

Sic animis natum inventumque poe'ma juvandis,

Si paulum a summo decessit, vergit ad imum.

Ludere qui nescit, campestribus abstinet armis,
Indoctusque pilae discive trochive quiescit 380
Ne spissae risum tollant impune coronaeg

Qui nescit, versus tamen audet fingere !—Quidni ,9

the pillars of the booksellers‚ that is, booksellers' shops, refuse to
receive it. The comment of Hurd is extremely apposite: “ This judg-
ment, however severe it may seem, is according to the practice of the
best critics. We have a remarkable instance in the case of Apollonius
Rhodius, who, though in the judgment of Quintilian, the author of no
contemptible poem, yet, on account of that equal mediocrity which every
where prevails in him, was struck out of the list of good writers by such
sovereign judges of poetical merit as Aristophanes and Aristarchus;
Quinctil. x. 1.’'

374—376. 374. Ut gratas inter mensas, &a The poet here assigns
a very just and obvious reason fior the decision which he has just made
respecting mediocrity in the poetic art. As the main end of poetry is·
to please, if it does not reach that point, ( which it cannot do by stopping
ever so little on this side of excellence,) it is like indifferent music, indif-
ferent perfumes, or any other indifferent thing which we can do without,
and whose end should be to please‚ namely offensive and disagreeable, and,
sor want of being very good, absolutely and insufferably bad-375.
Crassum. Compare the explanation of D’oring: “ Non liquidum, sed
coagulatum et rancidzmi.’'—-Sardo cum melle papaver. Sardinia was
full of bitter herbs, (Virg. Eclog. vii. 441.) whence the honey of the
island was bitter and in bad repute. The honey of Corsica was in
equally low esteem 3 but whether it was owing to the yew—trees of the
island, or to some other cause, has been made a matter ot' doubt. (Com-
pare Martyn, ad Virg. Eclog. ix. 30.) White poppy-seed roasted was
mingled with honey by the ancients.-—376. Poterat duci. “Could be
prolonued.'’

3790—383. 379. Ludere qui nescit, campestribus abstinet armis, ὅτε.
The poet, (from line 379 to 391,) gives the general conclusion which he
had in view, namely‚ that as none but excellent poetry will be allowed,
it should be awarning to writers how they engage in it without abilities‚
or publish without severe and frequent correction. But to stimulate, at
the same time, the poet who, notwithstanding the allowances already
made, might be somewhat struck with this last reflection, he flings out
(from line 391 to 408> a fine encomium on the dignity and excellence of
the art itself, by recounting its ancient honours. This encomium, besides
its great usefulness in invigorating the mind of the poet, has this farther
view, to recommend and revive, together with its honours, the office of
ancient poesy 3 which was employed about the noblest aud most import-
ant subjects ; the sacred source from which those honours were derived.
