266 Q. nonam FLACCI

Non huc Argoo contendit remige pinus,
Neque impudica, Colchis intulit pedem 3 60
Non huc Sidonii torserunt cornua nautae,
Laboriosa nec cohors Ulixei.

Ut inquinavit aere tempus aureum:
Aerea dehinc ferro duravit saecula 3 quorum 65

Piis secunda, vate me, datur fuga.

the remote situation of these blissful regions, far from the crimes and
horrore of civil dissension.—65. Quorum piis secunda, διο. “From
which age of iron, an auspicious escape is granted to the picus, according to
the oracle which 1 pronounce.''—With quorum understand soeculorum.
—The language of the poet is here based upon the custom, followed in ’
the most ancient times, of leading forth colonies under the guidance of
some diviner or prophet, after the oracle had been duly consulted, and its

‘will ascertained.

Epona XVII.—-A pretended recantation of the 5th Epode, to which suc-
ceeds the answer of Canidia, now rendered haughty and insolent by success.
The submission of the hard, however, and the menaces of the sorceress,
are only irony and satire, so much more severe and violent as they are more
disguised.

1—7. 1. Efficaci do manus scientiae. “ Ι yield submissive to thy
mighty art ; '’ i„ e. Ι acknowledge and submit to thy power, mighty sor-
