Vulgari fidicen : juvat immemorata ferentem
Ingenuis oculisque legi manibusque teneri.

Scire velis, mea cur ingratus opuscula lector :³5
Laudet ametque domi, premat extra limen iniquus?
Non ego ventosae plebis suffragia venor
Impensis coenarum et tritae munere vestis ;
Non ego, nobilium scriptorum auditor et ultor,
Grammaticas ambire tribus et pulpita dignor: -w
Hinc illae lacrimae ! Spissis indigna theatris
Scripta pudet recitare, et nugis addere pondus.

and, with respect to the expression, Latinus fidicen, compare Ode iv. iii.
23. “Romanae fidicen Lyrae.—33.1mmemorata. “A new species of
poetry3' ’1110111115 “productions unmentioned before3 ” i. e. bx any
Latin bard. The reference' 15 to lyric v.erse Itis deserving of remark,
however, that although Horace did not imitate Sappho less thari
Archilochus and Alcaeus, yet he does not say he was the first of the
Romans who imitated her, because Catullus, and some other Latin
poete, had written Sapphic verses before him.

35-41, 35. Ingratus. “Ungratefulss' for not acknowledging 1.1
public the pleasure which the reading of om· poet s works gave him 111
private. -36. Premat. “Decries them.'' Doring supposes an ellipsis
of invidia, or else that premat is here equu alent simply to contemnat.—
37. Non ego ventosae plebis suffragia venor, ἃς. As regards the epithet
ventosae, consult note on Epist. 1. viii. 12. Horace ridicules, with great
phasantry, the foolish vanity of certain poets, his contemporaries, who,
to gain the applause of the populace, courted them with entertainmems
and presents of cast-off clothing. Suffragia is here equivalent to
gratiam or favorem—39. Non ego nobilium scriptorum auditor ec altor,
ἃς. “ I do not deign, as the auditor and defender of noblesswriterffi
to go around among the tribes and stages of the Grammarians.'’ it
was customary about this period, at Rome, for many who aspired to
the reputation of superior learning, to 0 ven, as it were, a kind of school
or auditor), in which the productions of living writers were read by
their authors, and then criticised. Horace styles this class of persons
Θναηινηαῐὶεἰ and informs us that he nexer deigned to approach such
hot-beds of conceit‚ either for the purpose of listening to these distin-
guished effusions, or of defending them from the attacks of criticism:
and hence the odium which he incurred' among these impudent pre-
tenders to literary merit. It is exident that nobilium is here ironical.
-Utton Compare the explanation of Doring: Ultor, qai aliquem a
reprehensione, criminatione zel injuria aliqua defendit, is ejus est quosz
ultor, vindex, patronus. —40. Palpita. The stages from which the
recitations above referred to were made. —4l. Hinc illae lacrimae. A
proverbial expression, borrow ed from the 'Andria of Terence, 1. i. 91,
and there used in its natural meaning, but to he rendered here in
accordance with the spin't of the present passage: “Hence all this
spite and malice.”
