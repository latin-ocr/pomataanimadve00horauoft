370 Q. HORATII FLAccr

Sudando: pinguem vitiis albumque neque ostrea

N ec scarus aut poterit peregrina juvare lagois.

Vix tamen eripiam, posito pavone, velis quin

Hoc potius, quam gallina, tergere palatum,

Corruptus vanis rerum, quia veneat auro 25
Rara avis et picta pandat spectacula cauda ;

Tanquam ad rem attineat quidquam. Num vesceris ista,
Quam laudas, pluma? cocto num adest honor idem ἓ

Carne tamen quamvis distat nihil hac magis illa,

to signify every thing eaten with bread or besides bread, and hence,
finally, they serve to indicate all manner of delicate and sumptuous
dishes.—‘.ll. Pinyuem vitiis· albumque. “ Bloated and pale with exces-
sive indulgence.” Vitiis here alludes to high-living generally, and to all
the evils that follow in its train.——Ostrea. To be pronounced, in metrical
reading, as a dissyllable, ost-ra.—22. Scarus. Consult note on Epode
ii. 50.—La90is. The Layois is quite unknown: some think it a bird,
others a fish. The former, very probably, is the true opinion, as the
fish of this name (the Cyclopterus Lampus of modern ichthyology) is not
esculent. The bird layoz's is said to have tasted like a hare, whence its
name from the Greek λαγώς. Baxter makes it the same with the
Greek λαγώπους, a species of grouse, which the French term Francolin,
and the Germans Birkhulm or Berylzulm. Schneider, however, in his
Lexicon, (ε.υ.λαγώς,) thinks that the layopus corresponds to the modern
Schneehuhn, or “ White Game.”

23—29. 23. 173oe tamen eripiam, ἃς. “ And yet witthifliculty will
1 prevent thee, if a peacock be served up, from wishing to gratify thy
palate with this, rather than a fowl, misled as thou ait by mere outside,
because,” διο. The idea intended to be conveyed is this: And yet, aster
all my advice, and all my precepts to the contrary, I shall have no easy
task in eradicating from thy mind that false opinion, which, based on
mere externa] appearance, leads thee to prefer the peacock, as an article
of food, to the common fowl, merely because the former is a dearer bird,
and adorned with a rich and gaudy plumage.—25. Vanis rerum. A
= Graecism for vanis mona-26. Et picta pandat spectacula cauda. “And
unfolds to the view a brilliant spectacle with its gaudy tail.”—27. Tan-
quam ad rem, &c. ‘⁶ As if this were any thing to the purpose ;” i. e.
as if this rarity and beauty of the peaeock have any thing at all to do
with the taste of it.-28. Cocto num adest, &a No ecthlipsis operates
in num, but in metrical reading the word must be retained unaltered,
coeto num adesa—Honor idem. ‘⁴ The same beauty.”-29. Carne
tamen quamvis, διο. The meaning of this passage has given rise to
much contrariety of opinion. The following appears to us to yield the
fairest sense: ‘⁴ Though there is indeed a difference in the flesh of the
fowl and the peacock, yet it is plainly evident that thou art deceived not
more by the latter than the former, but merely by the discrepancy in
cxternal appearance ;'' i. e. Quamvis distat gallinae caro a pavonis, tamen
nihil (non) hac (pavonis) magis illa (gallinae, sed) imparibus formis de-
ceptum te esse patet.
