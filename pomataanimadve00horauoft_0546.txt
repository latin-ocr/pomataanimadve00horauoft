504 Q. HORATII FLACCI

EPISTOLA XIII.
AD VINIUM ASELLAM.

UT proficiscentem docui te saepe diuque,
Augusto reddes signata volumina, Vini,

Si validus, si laetus erit, si denique poscet ,-
Ne studio nostri pecces, odiumque libellis
Sedulus importes opera vehemente minister.
Si te forte meae gravis uret sarcina chartae,
Abjicito potius, quam quo perferre juberis
Clitellas ferus impingas, Asinaeque paternum
Cognomen vertas in risum, et fabula fias.
Viribus uteris per clivos, fiumina, lamas : 10

knee, has acknowledged the supremacy of Caesar.” Jus imperiumque,
as here employed, includes the idea of both civil and military power3 i. e.
full and unlimited authority. The allusion is to the event already men-
tioned in the note on Ode 1. xxvi. 3. when Phrahates, through dread of
the Roman power, surrendered the Roman standards and captives.

Emsrm X111.—-The poet, having entrusted Vinius with several rolls
of 'his writing (volumina) that were to be delivered to Augustus, amuses
himself with giving him directions about the mode of carrying them, and
the form to be observed in presenting them to the emperor.

1-7. l. Ut proficiscentem docui, ἃς. “ Vinius, thou wilt present
these sealed rolls to Augustus, in the way that I repeatedly and long
taught thee when setting out ;” z‘. e. in handing these rolls to the
emperor, remember the many and long instructions which I gave thee at
thy departure—‘2- Siynata volumina. Horace is supposed by the com-
mentators to have sent on this occasion not only the epistle to Augustus,
(the first of the second book,) but also the last odes and epistles he had
written. He calls these pieces volumina, because they were separately
rolled up ; and they are scaled, in order that they may not be exposed
to the prying curiosity of the courtierS.— Vini. Vinius is thought to
have been one of our poet’s neighbours, and a man evidently of low
birth. The family, however, rose into importance under the succeed—
ing emperors, and we find Titus Vinius filling the consulship under
Galba—3. Sa· validus, si laetus erit, ἃς. “ If he shall be in health, if
in spirits, if, in fine, he shall ask for them.” Validus stands opposed
to male validus. With poscet we may supply tradi sibi volumina—4.
Ne studio nostri pecces, &a ‘⁴ Lest through eagemess to serve me
thou give offence, and industriously bring odium on my productions,
by appearing in the character of an over-officious agent.''—6. Uret,-

thy family name of Asella. Horace puns upon the name of his neigh-
