EXCURSCS. 635

13. 24. seqq. Compare the scholiast. ad loc.) The Dithyrambic chorus
was also called Cyclian, (Κύκλιος,) from their daneinrg in a ring round
the altar of Bacchus whilst they sung the hymn. ( Bentley, Phal. p. 80.

This exhibition never suffered any material change, but always formed
an important part of the Dionysian festival, and was performed by a
chorus of fifty men. (Simonides, Epigr. 76.) In later ages, when a
regular theatre was erected, a portion of it, called the ὀρχήστρα, or
dancing—space‚ was set apart for the performance of the song and danne,
round the Θυμέλη or altar. (Mus. Crit. vol. ii. p. 74.)

The next advance in the developement of the Drama wae the inven-
tion os the Satyru- chorus. (Schneider, de Orig. Trag. p. 7. seqq.)
At what period and by whom this chorus was introduced, are pssints of
utter uncertainty. Wine and merriment probably first suggested the
idea of imitating, in frolic, the supposed appearance of the Satyrs, by
fixing horns on the head, and covering the body with a goat’s skin.
The manners of these sportive beings would, of course, be adopted
along with the guise, while jest and sarcasm were bandied about. Be
this as it may, a chorus of Satyrs was by some means formed, and
thencefort'n became an established accompaniment of the Bacchic festi-
val. lt is now that we first discover something of a dramatic nature.
The singers of the dithyramb were mere choristers3 they assumed no
character, and exhibited no imitation. The performers in the new
chorus had a part to sustain : they were to appear as SatyrS, and repre·
sent the character of those gamesome deities. Hence the duties of
this chorus were two-sold: As personating the attendants of Bacchus,
and in conformity with the custom at his festivals, they sung the praises
of the god 3 and next they poured forth their ludicrous effusions, which,
to a certain degree, were of a dramatic nature, but uttered without
system or order, just as the ideas suggested themselves to each per-
former. These αὐτοσχεδιάσματα were accompanied with dancing,
gesticulation, and grimace 3 and the whole bore a closer resemblance to
a wild kind of ballet than any other modern performanee. This rude
species of Drama was afterwards called τραγῳδία, (i. e. τράγου ᾠδή,’)
either from the goat-skin dress of the performers, or what is more pro-
bable, from the goat which was assigned as the prize to the cleverest
wit and nimblest dancer in the chorus.

Thespis, a native of Icaria, an Athenian village, was the author of
the third stage in the progress of the Drama, by adding an actor dis-
tinct from the chorus. When the performers, after singing the Bac-
chic hymn, were beginning to flag in the extemporal bursts of Satyric
jest and gambol which succeeded, Thespis himself used to come for-
ward, and from an elevated stand exhibit, in gesticulated narration,
some mythologice] story. When this was ended, the chorus again
commenced their performance. (Diog. Laert. Vit. Plat. 66.) These
dramatic recitations encroached upon the extemporal exhibitions of the
chorus, and finally occupied their place. Besides the addition of an
actor, Thespis first gave the character of a distinct profession to this
species of entertainment. He organized a regular chorus, which he
assiduously trained in all the niceties of the art, but especially in
dancing. (Athenaeus, i. 22.-Aristoph. Vesp. 1470.) With this band
of performers he is said to have strolled about from village to village,
directing his route by the succession of the several local festivals, and
