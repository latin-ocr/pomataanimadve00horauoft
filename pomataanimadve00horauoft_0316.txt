276 Q. HORATII FLACCI CARMEN SAECULARE.

Augur, et fulgente decorus arc-u
Phoebus, acceptusque novem Camenis,
Qui salutari levat arte fessos

Corporis artus,

Si Palatinas videt aequus arces, 65
Remque Romanam Latiumque, felix,
Alterum in lustrum, meliusque semper

Proroget aevum.

Quaeque Aventinum tenet Algidumque,
Quindecim Diana preces virorum 70
Curet, et votis puerorum amicas

Applicet aures.

Haec J ovem sentire, deosque cunctos,

Spem bonam certamque domum reporto,

Doctus et Phoebi chorus et Dianae 75
Dicere laudes.

seqq—Pax ‚· an allusion to the closing of the temple of Janus. Consult
note on Ode iv. xv, 8.—Pudorque priscus. ‘⁴ And the purity of earlier
days.''—-59. Beata pleno, &c. Compare Epist. 1. xii. 28. ‘¹ Aurea*
sruyes Italiae pleno defudit copia cornu.’'

61—73. 61. Augur, et sulyente, ἃς. “May Apollo, god of pro-
phecy, and adorned with the glittering bow,” δια-63. Qui salutari levat
arte, &c.; an allusion to Apollo, as the god of medicine. Compare the
appellations bestowed upon him by the Greek poete, in reference to this ς
ἀκέσιος, ἤπιος, σωτήρ, &c. In this stanza it m‘ll be perceived that the
four attributes of Apollo are distinctly expressed: his skill in oracular
divination, in the ‘use of the bow, in music, and in the healing art.—65.
Si Palatinas videt aequus arces. “ If he looks with a favouring eye on
the Palatine summits3 ’³ i. e. if he leuds a favouring ear to the solemn
strains which we are now pou-ring forth in his temple on the Palatino hill.
—67. Alterum in lustrum, &e. “ For another lustrum, and an always
happier age.’'——69. Aventinum. Diana had a temple on the Aventine
hill.—Al9idum. Consult note on Ode 1. xxi. 6.-70. Quindecim
preces virorum. The Quindecimviri‚ to whose custody the Sibylline

books were confided, always began their consultation of these oracles with ’

prayers. To them also was entrusted the general superintendence of the
Saecular solemnities.-73. Haec Jovem sentire, &c. The order of cou-
struction is as follows : Eyo chorus, doctus dicere laudes et Phoebi et
Dianae, reporto domum bonam certamque spem, Jovem cunctosque
deos sentire haee. This proceeds from the united chorus of youths and
maidens, who, being represented by their coryphaeus, or leader, appear as a
single indjvidual. In our own idiom, however, the plural must be substi-
tuted ε “ We, the choruS‚'' &c.—Haec sentire. “ Ratifv these our prayers.’'
Semire is here used in the sense of sanqire.
