3.—}0. 3. Amatqne janua limen. A beautiful expression. Com·
pare virgil, (Aen. V. 163J) “ Litus amas' aud Statius, (Silv. 11. iii. 56.) 4⁴
‘⁴ Umbris sinuatur amantibus undas.”—5. Multum sacili-9. “ Most Ἰ ‘⁷²
easily.''—7. M‘e tuo lonyas, &c. Intended for the words of a serenade.
——lO. Levis. “ Thinly clad.'' then poverty shall have succeedcd, as
it inevitany must, to a career of vicious indulgence, the light vestments of
summer will be thy only protection against the wintry blasts.

11-20, 11. Thracio vento. By the ‘⁴ Thracian wind '' is meant.
Boreas, or the north wind, whose native land, according to the Greek
poets, was the country of Thrace.—Sub interlunia. ‘⁴ At the time which
intervenes between the old and new moon.’' Or in freer and more
poetic language, “ during the dark and stormy season when the moon
has disappeared from the skies.”—l4. Quae solet matres, &m An
allusion to the same idea that is expresscd by the Greek ἱππομανεΐν.
Consult Heyne, ad Viry. Geory. iii. 280.—-15. Jecur ulcerosam. The
liver was supposed hythe ancients to be the primm-y receptacle of the
blood, whence it was diffused over the whole system z hence it became
also the seat of the passions.—17. Hedera' virenti. The “ verdant ivy ”
and the ‘² dark myrtle’‘ are here selected as fit emblems of youth. The
leaves of the latter, in general of a dark hue, are more particularly so
when young.—-20. Dedicet Euro. The common text has Hebro. The
objoefiou, however, to this reading is the utter impossibility of asso-
ciating the idea of a Thracian river with an act performed by Roman
youth. The propriety of styling the wind Eurus, “the companion of
winter,” may on the other hand easily be defended by the expression of
ἪΓὲἱῙῑ (Geory. ii. 339 z) “ Hibernas Euri flatus.’' To ‘⁶ devote to
E01‘²1⁵‚'’ moreover. coincides prccisely with our own form of expression,-
“ to scatter to the winds.’'
