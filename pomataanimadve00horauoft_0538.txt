496 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Certius accipiet damnum propiusve medullis,

Quam qui non poterit vero distinguere falsum.

Quem res plus nimio delectavere secundae, , 30
Mutatae quatient. Si quid mirabere, pones

Invitus. Fuge magna ς licet sub paupere tecto

Reges et regum vita praecurrere amicos.

Cervus equum pugna melior communibus herbis
Pellebat, donec minor in certamine longo 35
Iinploravit opes hominis, frenumque recep-it.

Sed postquam victor violens-discessit ab hoste,

Non equitem dorso, non frenum depulit ore.

Sic, qui pauperiem veritus potiore metallis

Libertate caret, dominum vehet improbus, atque 40
Serviet aeternum, quia parvo nesciet uti.

Cui non conveniet sua res, ut calceus olim,

30—38. 30. Quem res plus nimio, &a The idea intended to be con-
veyed is this: They who bound their desires by the wants of nature
(and such is usually the temper of a country life) are independeut of
Fortune's favours and resentments, her anger and inconstancy.—3l. Si
quid mirabere, pones invitus. ‘⁶ If thou shalt admire any thing greatly,
thou wilt beunwilling to resign it.”—3·2. Licet sub paupere teoto, διο.
“ One may live more happily beneath an humble roof, than the power-
ful and the friends of the poweiful.”—33. Reyes is here equivalent to
potentiores or ditiores—24. Cervus equum, &a The fable here told is
imitated from Stesichorus, who repeated it to the inhabitants of Himera,
in Sicily, when the latter were about to assign a body-guard to Phala—
ris, tyrant of Agrigentum, whom they had called to their aid, and made
commander of their forces. Stesichorus, as Aristotle inferms us, (Rhet.
ii. 39‚) undertook by this apologue to show the Himereans of what
folly they would be guilty, if they thus delivered themselves up into
the hands of a powerful individuar—C'ommunihus herbis. “ From their
common pasture.”—35. Alinor. ‘⁴ Worsted.‘' Proving inferior.-—-37.
Victor violens. “ A proud victor.”—38. Depulit ; equivalent to depel-
lere· potuit.

39-50, 39. Sic, qui pauperiem veritus, &Q “ In like manner, he
who, fr'om a dread of narrow circumstances, parts with his liberty, more >
precious th'an any metals, shall shamefully bear a master, and be for
ever a slave, because he shall not know how to be contented with a
little ;” i. e he who, not content with a little, regards the precious boon
of freedom as of inferior moment when compared with the acquisition
of riches, shall become the slave of wealth, and live in etex-nal bondage.
—Metallis. Used contemptuously for divitiis.—42. Oui non conveniet
sua res;'&c. The idea intended to be conveyed is simply this : When
a man's fortune does not suit his condition, it will be like a shoe, which
is apt to cause us to trip if too large, and which pinches when too small„
