Q. HORATII FLACCI EPISTOLARUM LIB. Ι. 1. ⁴51

Non eadem est aetas, non mens. Veianius, armis
Herculis ad postem fixis, latet abditus agro, 5
Ne populum extrema toties exoret arena.

Est mihi purgatam crebro qui personet aurem :

Solve senescentem matare sanus equum, ow

Peccec ad extremum ridendus, et ilia ducat.

Nunc itaque et versus et cetera ludicra pono ; 10

cised and trained 3 (ludus ylarliatorius ,·) and hence those who were ‹lis-
missed on account of age, οι· any other cause, were said delusisse.
Horace began to write about twenty-six years of age, and he is now
forty-six, so that the expression (nitique ludo is used with great pro-
priety, as also uon, eadem est aetas, in the succeeding line.

my habits of thinking are clianged.''-- Veianius. A celebrated gladia-
tor of the day, who, haring obtained his dis-missal, retii-ed into the coun-
try, in order to avoid all risk of again engaging in the combats of the
arena—5. Herculis (ld postem. “ At the gate of the temple of Hereu-
les ;” literally, ¹⁶ at the door-post,” &cz It was customary with the
ancients, when they (liscontinued any art or calling, to offer up the in-
struments connected with it to the deity under whose auspices that art
or calling had been pursued. Gladiators. therefore, when they ceased
from the profession of arms, offered up their instruments of combat to
Hercules, who was regarded as the tutelary deity of this class of men.
—6. Ne populum extrema toties emm-et arena. ‘⁴ That he may not so
osten entreat the favour of the people from the extremity of the arena.''
The Badiam, as has already been remarked in a previous note, were
not again compelled to fight, but were sometimes, however, indueed by
great hire to appear once more in public and engage in combats. When
they resumed their profession in this way, and wished, aster having
served a second time, to be again dismissed, the same formality of
receiving the rudis had to be observed. When a gladiator requested
the favour of dismissal from the peoplc, he came to the edge or extre—
mity of the arena to prefer his supplication. By the arena is meant the
place in the amphitheatro where the gladiators fought. It received its
name from being covered with sanci, in order to prevent the combatants
from slipping, and to absorb the blood. Saw-dust was sometimes em-
ployed in place of sand.

continually ringing in my cleansed ear ;” i. e. in my ear that hears dis-
tinctly what is said. The connexion in the train of ideas is as follows :
In order that I may do what Veianius did, a monitor is not wanting
unto me, who fills my ear with these words, διε. The poet's monitor on
this ocoeision is his own better judgment.-8. Solve senescentem mature,
