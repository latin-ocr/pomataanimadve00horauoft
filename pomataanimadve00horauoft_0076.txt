:36 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Aequor. Non tibi sunt integra lintea,
Non di3 quos iterum pressa voees malo: 10
Quamvis Pontica pinus,
Silvae filia nobilis,

J actes et genus et nomen inutile.
Nil pictis timidus navita puppibus
Fidit. Tu, nisi ventis 15
Debes* ludibrium, cave.

Nuper sollicitum quae mihi taedium,
Nunc desit-legum, curaque non levis,
Interfusa nitentes

Vites aequora Cycladas. 1 Z 20

funibus carinae. “And thy hull, without cables to secure it.” Some
commentators think that the poet alhules to the practice usual among the
ancients of girding their vessels with cables, in violent storms, in order to
prevent the planks from starting {munden—8. Imperio-sius aequor. ‘⁶ The
increasing violence of the sea.'’ The comparative describes the sea as
growing every moment more and more violent.

10—13. 10. Di; alluding to the tutelary dejw' s, whose images were
accustomed to be placed, together with a snia altar, in the gtern of the
vessel, The figurative meaning of the poet presents to us the guardian
deities of Rome offended at the sanguinary excesses of the civil wars, and

rely too much upon the strength of her timbers.—l2. Sylva& filia nobilis.
‘⁸ The noble daughter of the forest.'’ A beautiful image, which Martial
appears to have imitated (xiV. 90) : “ Non sum Maurae filia silvae.'’
—13. Εἰ yenus et nomen inutile. “Both thy lineage and unavailing
fame.'’ The idea intended to be conveyed by the whole clause is as fol—
lows : “ Idle‚ Ο my country ¹. will be the boast of thy former glories, and
the splendour of thy ancient name.”

14—20. 14. Pictis puppibus. Resides being graced with the sta—
tues of the tutelary deities, the sterns of ancient vessels were likewise
embellishcd with paintings and other ornamenta—15. N isi debes ventis
ludibrium. “ Unlcss thou art doomed to be the sport of the winds.'' An
imitation of the Greek ἰᾶίοῃὲἱ ὄφλῃ-ν zimara—17. Nuper sollicitum, &e-
“ Thou who wert lately {resource of disquietudemnd weariness to·-me;
who at present art an object of fond desire and strong apprehension‚’' διο.
The expression sollicitum taedium refers to tho unquiet fcelings which
swayed the bosom of the poet during the period of the civil contest3 and
to the weariness and disgust which the long continuance of those scenos
produced in his breast. Under the sway of Augustus, however, his
country again becomes the idol of his warmest affection53 (desideriam ‚·)
and a feeling of strong apprehension (cura non levis) takes possession of
