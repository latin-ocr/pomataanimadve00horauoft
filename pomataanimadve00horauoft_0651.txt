EPISTOLA AD Pisoxr-s. 607

Aut agitur res in scenis, aut acta refertur.
Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem, 130
Quam quae suut oculis subjecta fidelil›u‹‚ et quae
Ipse sibi tradit spectator. N on tamen intus
Digna geri promes iu scenam ; multaque tolles
Ex oculis, quae mox narret facundia praesens.
Ne pueros coram populo Medea trucidet ; {85
Aut humana palam coquat exta nefarius Atreus ;
Aut in avem Progne vertatur, Cadmus in anguem.
Quodcunque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi.

Neve minor neu sit quinto productior actu
Fabula, quae posci vult et spectata reponi : lm„
N ec deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus
Inciderit: nec quarta loqui persona laboret.

159—188. 178. Aut agitur res in scenis, ant acta refertur. “An
action is either represented on the stage, or is there related as done
elsewhere.” Hurd gives the connexion as follows: The niisapplica--
tion just now mentioned (lines 176 and 177) destroys the credibility.
This puts the poet in mind of another misconduct‚ which has the sanic
effect, viz. intus digna geri promere in scenam. But, before hc makes
this remark, it was proper to promise a concession to prevent mistakes‚
viz. Segnius irritant animos, &cz—18²2. Non tumen intus digna geri,
&e The idea intended to be conveyed is this, that though what we
see done affeets us more strongly than what we merely hear related,
still (tamen) we must not let this principle carry us so far as to bring
upon the stage things only fit to be donc behind the soenes (intus).—
184. Quae mm narret Jizcundia praesens. “ Which the animated narra-
tive of some actor, appearing on the stage, may presently' relate.¹'
Some commentators make praesens refer to the circumstance of the
actor's having been present at the scene which hc describes. The
acceptation in which we have taken it, however, is much more simple
and obvious—135. Ne pueros coram populo Medea trucidet. Seneca
violates this rule also, and represents Medea butchering her children
in the face of the spectatos, and aggravates the cruelty of the execu—
tion with all thc horrors of a lingering act.—186. Aut humana palam
coquat esta, &cu ; an allusion to the coena Thyestae, mentioned at verse
91.—187. In avem. According to Anacreoh, virgil, Propertius, and
others, she was changed into a nightingale; but, according to Ovid,
into a strahow—183. lncreducus odi. “ Ι view with feelings of incre-
dulity and disgust.”

189-192. 189. Neve minor neu sit quinto productior actufabnla.
Whether there be any thing of reality and truth in this precept, observes
Francis, may be disputed‚ but the best poets, ancient and modern, have
held it inviolable. They have considered it a just medium between a
length which might grow languishing and tedious‚ and a shortness tor,
much crowded with incidents.—‚19l. Nec deus intersit, nisi ‹liguu-
m'ndice nudus. “ Nor let any deity interfere, unless a difficulty present
