6 00 Q.. EORATII FLACCI

Et quocunque volent, animum auditoris agunto. 100
Ut ridentibus arrident, ita flentibus afflent

Humani vultus. Si vis me flere, dolendum est

Primum ipsi tibi 5 tunc tua me infortunia laedent,

Telephe vel Peleu. Male si mandata loqueris,

Vultum verba decent 3 iratum plena minarum ,ς

Ludentem lasciva3 severum seria dictu.

Fortunarum habitum 3 juvat, aut impellit ad iram,

Aut ad humum moerore gravi deducit et angit ; llo
Post effert animi motus interprete lingua.

Si dicentis erunt fortunis absona dicta,

Romani tollent equites peditesque cachinnum.

to 1110 establishment of the New Greek Comcdy. From this he proceeds
easily and gracefully to the Roman Stage, acknowledging the merits of
the writers, but pointing out their (1010015, 311(1 ass igning the causes.
