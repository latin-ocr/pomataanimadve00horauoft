EPISTOLA VII.
AD MAECENATEM.

QUINQUE dies tibi pollicitus me rure futurum,

Sextilem totum mendax desideror. Atqui

Si me vivere vis, recteque w'dere valentem,

Quam mihi das aegro, dabis aegrotare timenti,

Maecenas, veniam; dum ficus prima calorque 5
Designatorem decorat lictoribus atris,

Emsrm: VIL—Horace, upon retiring into the country, had given
his promise to Maecenas that he would return in five days; but aster
continuing there the whole month of August, he writes this epistle to
excuse his absence. He tells him that the care of his health had obliged
him to remain in the country during the dog-days ; and that, when win-
ter comes on, the same care would render it necessary for him to go to
Tarentum, but that he intended to be with him early in the spring. As
Horace, however, was under the strongest ties to Maecenas, and did not
Wish to be thought unmindful of what he owed him, he takes pains to
show, that the present refusal did not proceed from want of gratitude‚
but from that sense of liberty which all mankind ought to have, and
which no favour, however great, could countervail. Hc acknowledges
his patron's liberality, and the agreeable manner he had of cvincing it.
He acknowledges, too, that he had been a close attendant upon him in
his younger years, but assures him, at the same time, that if he was less
assiduous now, it did not proceed from want of affection and friendship,
but from these infirmities of age, which, as they were sensibly growing
upon him, rendered it inconsistent with the care which his health de-

manded of him.

am expected by thee during the whole month of August.” The Ro-
man‘S, at first, began their vear at March, whence the sixth month was
called Sextilis, even after January and February were added by Numa
to the calendar of Romulus. It afterwards took the name of Augus-
tus, mensis Auyustus, as the month before it was called mens-is Julius
from Julius Caesar.—Atqui. “ And ,ναῒ-3. Recteque videre valentem.

apart from his patron's presence—Dum ficus prima, 8εο. An elegant
and brief description of the season of autumn, when the fig first reaches
its maturity, and the heat of the sun proves injurious to the human
frame. The dog-days, and in general all the autumnal season, were
sickly at Rome. At this time the poet chose to retire to his Sabine
farm, and breathe the pure mountain atmosphere.—6. Designatorem
decorat lictoribus atris. “Adorn the undertaker with all his gloomy
train.” By the desiynator is here meant the individual whose business
it was to regulate the order of funerans, and assigu to every person his
