SERMONUM LIB. 11. 6. 425

Praedia Caesar an est Itala tellure daturus?

J urantem me scire nihil mirantur ut uuum

Scilicet egregii mortalem altique silenti.

Perditur haec inter misero lux, 11011 51110 votis :

O rus, quando ego te adspiciam ἓ quandoque licebit, 60
Nunc veterum libris, nunc somno et inertibus horis

Ducere sollicitae jucunda oblivia vitae?

O quando faba Pythagorae cognata, simulque

Uncta satis pingui ponentur oluscula lardo?

O noctes coeuaeque desim ! quibus ipse meique 65
Ante larem proprium vescor, vernasque procaces

Pasco libatis dapibus. Prout cuique libido cst,

Siccat inaequales calices conviva solutus

as some pretend, but “ hours of peaceful abstraction from the world.”—

of the cares of life ;” a beautiful allusion to the sabled waters of Lethe,
which all who entered Elysium previously drank, and lost in.conse-
quence, every recollection of the cares and troubles of life.”—6 3. Faba
Pytkayorae coqnala. “ The bean related to Pythagoras ;'' a pleasant
allusion to the famous precept of Pythagoras, to abstain from beans,
κυάμων ἀπέχεσθαι. This precept is one of the mysteries which the
ancient Pythagoreans never disclosed. Horace, however, evidently refers
here to that solution which makes the philosopher to have regarded
beans as among the receptacles of souls, and hence he jocosely styles the
bean coynata, on the supposition of its containing the soul of some rela-
tion of the sage'S. ’

born in their master's house were called vernae, and were more forward
and pert than others, because they were commonly more indulged—67.
