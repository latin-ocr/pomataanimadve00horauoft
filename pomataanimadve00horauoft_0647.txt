EPISTOLA AD PISONES. 60³

Interpres ; nee desilies imitator in arctum,

Unde pedem proferre pudor vetet aut operis lex. 135
Nec sic incipieS, ut scriptor cyclicus olim :

Fortunam Priami cantabo ot nobile bellum.

Quid dignum tanto feret hic promissor hiatu ’ἓ

Parturiunt montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.

Quanto rectius hic, qui nil molitur inepte : 140

Dic milei, illusa, virum, captae post tempora Trojae,

Qui mores hominum multorum cidit et urbes.

Nou fumum cx fulgore, sed ex fumo dare lucem

instead of imitators.—134. Nec desilies imitator in arctum, διο. Phe
third mle: Not to be slavish in our imitation, or advance so far as to
involve oursel=.·es in circumstances whence we cannot retreat with
honour, or without violating the very laws we have established for the
conduct of the poem. Hence the passage may be rendered as follows:
“Nor shalt leap, as an imitator, into straits, whence either a sense
ot' shame, or the rules of thy work, may forbid thee to retreat ;” i.e.
nor, like a servile imitator, shalt fetter thyself by such narrow rules, as·
to be entangled beyond the power of retreat, without violating what
honour and the rules of our work demand—Arctum. Understand
locum. Some commentators suppose, that the reference is here to the
fable. of the goat in the well.

136—141. 136. Nec sic incipies, aze. Most of the critics observe‚
remarks Colman, that all these documents, deduced from the Epic, are
intended, like the reduction of the Iliad into acts, as directions and
admonitions to the dramatic viritem—Ut scriptor cyclicus olim. ‘⁴ Like
the cyclic bard of old.” By the cyclic poets, are meant a class of
bards who selected, for the subjects of their productioris, things trans-
acted as well during the Trojan war, as before and after ; and who, in
treating these subjects, confined themselves within a certain round or
cycle of fable.” From the hackneyed nature of these themes, the term
cyclicus came at length to denote a poet of inferior rank, and, indeed,
of little or no merit.—l37. Fortunam Priami cantabo et nobile bellum.
Ἀεὶσω Πριάμοιο τύχην πόλεμόν τε κλεενόνόν.-Ρανεαηάἠί montes, δια,
alluding to the well-known fable of the mountain and the mouse;
and applied, as a proverbial expression, to all pompous and imposing
beginnings‚ which result in nothing—1402 Quanto rectius hic, qui nil
molitur inepte. “ How much more correctly does he begin who attempts
nothing injudiciously.” The allusion is to Homer, and Horace opposes
to the pompous and swening exordium of the cyclic poet, the modesty
and reserve of Homer in the beginning of the Odyssey.-l4l. Dic mihi,
Musa, virum, διε. Horace here includes in two lines the three opening
verses of the Odyssey. The Roman poet does not mean his lines as a
translation of these, in the strict sense of the term, but merely wishes
to convey, in his native tongue‚ some idea of the simplicity and modesty
that mark the Homeric exordium. “

143—151. 143. Non sumwm ex ‚halym-e, διο. The meaning is,
that Homer does not seek to begin with a flash and end in smoke, but
