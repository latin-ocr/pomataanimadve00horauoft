Hic ego mendacem stultissimus usque puellam
Ad mediam noctem exspecto ε somnus tamen aufert
[utentum Veneri 3 tum immundo somnia visu
N octurnam vestem maculant ventremque supinum. 85

Inde Rubos fessi pervenimus, utpote longum
Carpentes iter et factum corruptius imbri. 95
Postera tempestas melior, via pejor ad usque
Bari moenia piscosi. Dehinc Gnatia. lymphis

is gritty.’' With lapidosus supply panis. Canusium was situatc on the
right bank of the Aufidus, or Osanto, and about twelve miles from its
mouth—Aquae non ditior urna. “Though here the pitcher >is no
better supplied with water than at the former place ; ’⁹ i. e. Canusium
labours under the same scarcity of good water as Equus Tuticus.

94—97. 94. Rubos. Rubi, now Ruvo, lay to the south-east of
