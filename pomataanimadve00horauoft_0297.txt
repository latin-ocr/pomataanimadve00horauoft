EPODON mnan. 12. 257

Ad non amicos heu! mihi postes, et heu!
Limina dura, quibus lambos et infregi latus.
Nunc, gloriantis quamlibet mulierculam
Vincere mollitia, amor Lycisci mc tenet:
Unde expedire non amicorum queant 25
Libera consilia, nec contumeliae graves;
Sed alius ardor aut puellae candidae,
Aut teretis pueri, longam renodantis comam„

CARMEN XII.

IN ANUM LIBIDINOSAM

QUID tibi vis, mulier nigris dignissima barris?
Munera eur mihi, quidve tabellas

Mittis, nec firmo juveni, neque naris obesae?
Namque sagacius unus odoror,

Polypus, an gravis hirsutis cubet, hircus in alis, 5
Quam canis acer, ubi lateat sus.

Qui sudor vietis et quam malus undique membris
Crescit odor! quum, pene soluto,

Indomitam properat rabiem sedare ; neque illi
Jam manet humida creta, colorque 10

made these declaration-³ iu thy presence.” As regards the meaning which
laudare here hears, compare the remark of Aulus Gellius (ii. ὓ) 2
“ Laudare siynificat prisca linqua, nominare appellareque.’' Hence
this verb is frequently used (especially in the editorial Latinity of modern
times) iu the sense of “ to mentiou‚'’ ‘⁴ cite‚'’ “ quote‚'’ ‘⁴ call byname‚''
διε. Some editors make the meaning of uhi haee laudaveram to be,
“ When I had applauded myself for this resoluti‹›n.’' Such an interpre-
tation is not correct —Te palam. The ablativo here depende on palam,
which has the force of a proposition. This is far, however, from being an
ἅπαξ λεγόμενον, as some critice seem to think. Other examples of a
similar usage are as follows ε Livy, vi. 14. “ palam populo.'' Ovid. de
Arte Amandi‚ ii. 549; Trist. v. x. 49. “me palam.’' Auct. Com.
ad Liv. (in Ouid.) 442. “ palam omnibus‚’' aud Livy, xxv, 18. where
Gronovius retains omnibus. but Drakenborch rejects it.—20. Jussus.
Understand a te.—Ferebar incerto pede. ‘⁴ 1 was carried with wavering
footstep.” The poet's resolution soon fails, and, on endeavouring to reach
his own home, in compliance with the admonition of his friend, he finds
himself once more at the gatc of Inachia. Some commentatore make
incerto pede refer to the uncertain sootsteps of an angry and agitatcd man τ
this, however, is decidedly inferiore—22. Quibus lumbos et insreyi latus.
