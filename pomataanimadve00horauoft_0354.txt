:314 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Qui captat risus hominum famamque dicacis,

Fingere qui non visa potest, commissa tacere

Qui nequit ε hic niger est, hune tu, Romane, caveto. 85
Saepe tribus lectis videas coenare quaternos,

E quibus imus amet quavis adspergere cunctos,

Praeter eum, qui praebet aquam : post, hunc quoque potus,
Condita quum verax aperit praecordia Liber:

Hic tibi comis et urbanus liberque videtur 90
Infesto nigris ε ego si risi, quod ineptus

Pastillos Rufillus olet, Gargonius hircum,

Lividus et mordax videor tibi ἓ Mentio si qua

racter or the feelings of others, if he cau but raise a laugh at their expense,
and who will sacrifice the ties of intimacy and friendship to some paltry
witticism.—S5. Hic niyer est, διο. “ This man is black of heart 3 shun
him thou that hast the spirit of a Roman.''

86—88. 86. Saepe tribus lectis, ἃς. The usual number of couches
placed around the mensa or table, in the Roman banqueting-room, was
three, one side of the table being left open for the slaves to bn'ng in and
out the dishes. On each couch there were commonly three guests‚
sometimes four. As Varro directs that the guests should never be below
the number of the Graces, nor above that of the Muses, four persons on
a couch would exceed this rule, and make what, in the language of the
day, would be called a large party. Hence the present passage of Horace
may be paraphrased as follows: “ One may often see a large party
assembled at supper.”-87. Imus. “He that occupies the lowest
seat.'' The allusion is to the scurra, buff00n‚ or jester‚ who occupied
the last seat on the lowest couch, immediately below the entertaincr.
&Vhen we speak here of the lowest couch in a Roman entertainment‚ the
term must be taken in a peculiar sense, and in accordance with Roman
usage. The following explanation may, in the absence of a diagram,
throw some light on this point. If the present page be imagined a
square, the top and two sides will represent the parts of a Roman table
along which the three couches were placed. The conch on the n'ght
hand was called summus lectus, the one placed along the side supposed

to correspond with the top of the page was called medius lectus, the ”

remaining couch, on the left, was termed imus lectus. The last seat on
this was the post of the scurra, and immediately above him reclined the ,
master of the feast-Quavis adspergere cunctos. “ To attack the whole
party with every kind of witticism ;'’ literally, ‘⁴ to besprinkle them all in
any way.” With quavis understand ratione, and not aqua, as some
commentators maiacum—88. Praeter eum, qui praebet aquam. “ Ex-
cept him who furnishes the water ;'' i. e. the entertainer‚ who supplies the
guests with water, either hot or cold, but more particularly the former, for
the purpose of tempering their wine.—Hune. The entertainer. Under-
stand adspergere. '
90—106. 90. Hic tibi comis, &c. “ And yet this man appears to
thee, who art such a foe to the black-hearted, courteous, entertaining,
and frankin disposition.” By nigris are here meant the whole race of
