CARMINUM Lm. 11. 13. 109

Quid quisque vitet, nunquam homini satis
Cautum est, in horas. Navita Bosporum
Poenus perhorrescit, neque ultra 15
Caeca timet aliunde fata ;

Miles sagittas et celerem fugam
Parthi3 catenas Parthus et Italum
Robur : sed improvisa leti
Vis rapuit rapietque gentes. 20

Quam paene furvae regna Proserpinae,
Et judicantem vidimus Aeacum :
Sedosque discretas piorum 3 et
Aeoliis fidibus querentem

Sappho puellis de popularibus 3 25
Et te sonantem plenius aureo,
Alcaee, plectro dura navis,
Dura fugae mala, dura belli.

13—18. 13. Quid quisque vitet, &c. ‘⁴ Mau is never sufficicntly
aware of the danger that he has every moment to avoid.’'—l4. Bospo-
γυνη alluding to the Thracian Bosporus, which was considered pecu-

prison.'’ The term robur appears to allude particularly to the well-known
prison at Rome called Tullianum.- it was originally built by Ancus
Martius, and afterwards enlarged by Servius Tullius, whence that part of
it which was under ground, and built by him, received the name of Tulli-
anum. Thus Varro (de Liny. Lat. 4) observes : “ In hoc, pars quae sub
terra Tullianum, ideo quod additum a Tullio ‘regest’ The full expres-
sion is “ Tullianum robur,’' from its walls having been originally of oak.
In this prison, captive monarchs, after having been led through the streets
of Rome in triumph, were confined. and either finally beheaded or starved
to death.

19-26. 19. Improvisa leti vis, &e. ⁴· The unforescen attack of
death has hurried off, and will continue· to hurty off, the natione of the
world.’'—2l. Quam paene furvae, διο. “ How near were we to behold-
ing the realms of sable Proserpina.”-—22. Judicantem. “ Dispensing
justice.”—23. Sedesque discretas priorum. “ The separate abodes of
the pious ;'' i. e. the abodcs of the good separated from those of the wicked.
The allusion is to ‘the Elysian fields.—24. Aeoliis fidibus querentem,
&m ⁸⁴ Sappho, complaining on her Aeolian lyre of the damsels of her
native island.'’ Sappho, the famous poetess, was born at Mitylene, in the
island of Lesbos ; and as she wrote in the Aeolic dialect, which was that
of her native island, Horace has designated her lyre by the epithet of
“Aeolian.”-26. Et te sonantem plenius aureO, διο, “ And thee,
