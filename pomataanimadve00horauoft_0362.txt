322 Q. HORATII FLACCI

Sarmenti (lomina exstat. Ab his majoribus orti 55
Ad pugnam venere. Prior Sarmentus : Equi te

Esseferi similem dico. Ridemus ς et ipse

Messius, Accipio ; caput et movet. O, tua cornu

Nisoret exsecto frons, inquit, quidsaceres, quam

Sic mutilus minitaris ,9 At illi foeda cicatrix 60
Setosam laevi frontem turpaverat oris.

Campanum iu morbum, in faciem permulta jocatus,
Pastorem saltaret uti Cyclopa, rogabat 3

Nil illi larva aut tragicis opus esse cothurnis.

Multa Cicirrus ad. haec: Donasset jamne catenam 65

“ Engaged in the conflict. ''—Messi clarum yenus Osci. —The construc-
tion is, Osci sunt clarum yenus Messi. By the Osci are here meant the
Campanians genemlly, who were notorious for their vices. Hence the
satirical allusion in the epithet clarum. -55. Sarmenti domina exstat.
“The mistress of Saumeutus still lives. '’ He was therefore a slave,
though his mistress probably was afraid of offending Maecenas, in whose
retinue he at present was, by claiming him as her property.-58. Accipio.
“ 'Tis even εο, Ι grant.” Messius jocosely admits the truth of the com-
parison, and shakes his head in imitation of a wild horse shaking its mane
for the purpose of alarining a foe. On this, Sarmentus renews the attack.
0, tua cornu, ἃς. Uttered by Sarmentus, and equivalent.to ‘⁴ O, quid
faceres, si tihi in fronte non etz-sectum esset cornu 52 ’' The allusion is
to a large wart which had been cut away from the left side of Messius’s
head—60. Cicalrzlv. The sear left after the lemoval of the wart.—6l.
Setosam laevi frontem oris. “ The bristly surfaec of his left temple-’'—
Setosam. Purposely used in place of hispidam-62. Campanum mor-
bum. T he disorder here alluded to was peculial· to Campania, and caused
large warts to grow on the tcmples of the head and on the face.—63.
Pastorem saltaret uti Cyclopa. “To dance the part of the Cyclops-
shepherd ;'’ i. e. to represent, in dancing, the part of Polyphemus, and
his ‚awkward and laughable wooing of the nymph Galatea. The allusion is
to the Roman pantomimes, a species of dramatic exhibition, in which
characters, either ludit-rous or grave, more commonly the fonner, were
represented by gesticulation and danciug, without words..-.64. Nil illi
larva, ἃς. The raillery is here founded on the great size and horrible
ngliness os Messius. His stature will save him the trouble of putting on
liigh—heeled cothurni, (like those used in tragedy,) in order to represent
the gigantis: size of Polyphemus3 while the villanous gash on his temple
vn‘ss make him look so like the Cyclops, that there will be no necessity
for his wearing a mask.

65—68. 65. Donasseejamne catenam, διο. A laughable allusion to
the slavery of Sarmentus. The Roman youth of good families, on attain-
ing the age of serentem, and assuming the mauly gown, were accus—
tomed to consecrate their bullae, or the little gold boss which they wore
depending from their necks. to the Larte or household deities. Iu like
manner young girls, when they had left the yseax of childhood‚ consc-
erated their dolls to the same. Messius makes a ludimous perversior] of
