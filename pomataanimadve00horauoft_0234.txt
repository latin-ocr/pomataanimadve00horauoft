Viti-eo daturus, &c. “ Destined to give a name to the sparkling deep.''
Vitreo is here rendered by some “ azu1e‚⁷' but incorrectly3 the idea is
borrowed from the sparkling of glass.—5. Monte. “ From some moun-
tain.”—6. Notas ripas. ‘¹ Its accustomcd banks.’'—7. Fervet immen-
susque, διο. “ Pindar foams, and rushes onward with the vast and deep
tide of song.'' The epithct immensus refers to the rich exuberancc, and
profundo ore, to the sublimity, of the hard—9. Donandns. ‘⁴ Deserv-
ing of being gifted.'’-10. Seu per audaces, &c. Horace here proceeds
to enumerate the several departmeuts of lyric verse, in all of which Pindar
stands pre-eminent. These are, 1. Ditlzyrambz'cs .· 2. Paeans, or hymns
and encomiastic effusione: 3. Epinz'cz'a (ἐπινίκια), or songs of victory,
composed in honour of the conquerors at public gamos: 4. Epicedia
(ἐπικήδεια), or funeral songs. Time has made iearful ravages in these

fragments, are forty—five of the ἐπινίκια ᾅσματα. —10. Nova verba.

dithyrambic poets, and more especially by Pindar, of forming novel com-

and of attaching to terms a boldness of meaning that almost amounts to a
change of signification. Hence the epithet “ daring,” audaces, applied to
this species of poetry. Dithyrambics were originally odes in praise 'of Bac-

leye solutis. ‘⁶ In unshackled numbers: '³ alluding to the privilege,
enjoyed ‘hy (lithyrambic poem, of passing rapidly and at pleasure from one .
measure to another.

13—32. 13. Seu deos, reyesve, &og alluding to the Paeans. The
reyes, deorum sanyuz'nem, are the heroes of earlier times 3 and the
reference to the Centaurs and the Chimaera calls up the recollection of
Theseus, Pirithous, aud Bellerophon—17. Sive quos Elea, &tt-‚3 alhui-
