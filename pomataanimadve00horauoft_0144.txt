104 Q. HORATH FLACCI

Auream quisquis mediocritatem 5
Diligit, tutus caret obsoleti
Sordibus tecti, caret invidenda

Sobrius aula.

Saepius ventis agitatur ingens
Pinus, et celsae graviore casu is?
Decidunt turres, feriuntque summos

Fulmina montes.

Sperat infestis, metuit secundis

Alteram sortem bene praeparatum

Pectus. Informes hiemes reducit 15
Jupiter, idem

Summovet. Non, si male nune, et olim
Sic erit. Quondam cithara tacentem
Suscitat Musam, neque semper arcum
Tendit Apollo. 20

Rebus angustis animosus atque

Fortis appare: sapienter idem

Contrahes vento nimium secundo
Turgida vela.

by that of the Latin) is worthy of notice. The whole passage may be para-
phrased as follows: “ YVhoever makes choice of the goldeu mean, safe
from all the ills of poverty, (tutus,) is not compellcd to dwell amid (earet)
the wretchedness of some miserable abode ς while, on the other hand,
moderate in his desires, (sobrius) he needs not (caret) the splendid
palace, the object of envy.’'—-9. Saepius. ‘⁶ More frequently ’' than trees
os lower size. Some editions have saevius.-10. Ee· celsae graviore casu,
&c. “ And lofty structures fall to the ground with heavier ruin ;’' i. e.
than humble ones.—-ll. Summos montes. “ The highest mountains.'’-
14. Alteram sortem. “ A change of condition.”-Bene praeparatum
pectus. “ A well-regulated breast.’'—l 5. Informes hiemes. “Gloomy
winters.'’—17. Non, si male nunc, &eu “ If misfortune attend thee
now, it will not also be thus hcreafter.’'—l 8. Quondam cithara taeen-
tem, &c. ‘⁴ Apollo oftentimes arouses with the lyre the silent muse, nor
always bends his bow.” The idea intended to be conveyed is, that, as
missortune is not to last for ever, so neither are the gods unchanging in
their anger towards man. Apollo stands forth as the representative of
Olympus, propitious when he strikes the lyre‚ offended when 'ne bends the
bow.—l9. Suscitat Musam ‚- equivalcnt in fact to edit sonos, pulsa
cithara. The epithet tacentem refers merely to an interval of silence on
the part of the muse 3 i. e. of anger on the partos the gode-21. Animosus
atque fortis. ⁸‘ Spirited and firm.'’
