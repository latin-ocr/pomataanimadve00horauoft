534 Q. rIORATn FLACCI

Quae scribuntur aquae potoribus. Ut male sanos
Adscripsit Liber Satyris Faunisque poetas,

Vina- fere dulces oluerunt mane Camenae. 5
Laudibus arguitur vini vinosus Homerus ;

Ennius ipse pater nunquam nisi potus ad arma

Prosiluit dicenda. Forum putecdque Libonis

Mandabo siccis, adimam cantare severis.

Hoc simul edixi, non cessavere poetae lo
Nocturno certare mero, putere diurno.

this particular they equalled them in merit. Horace laughs at such
ri=liculous imitation.

1-7, 1. Prisco Cratino. For some account of Cratinus consult the
note on Sat. 1. iv. [ψ’-ἶ. Nulla placere din nec vivere carmina possunt, &0-
This was probably one of Cratinus's verses, which Horace has trans-
lated.—3. Ut male sanos adscripsit Liber, 810. “Ever since Bacchus
ranked bards, seized with true poetic fury, among his Fauns and Satyrs,
the sweet Muses have usually smelt of wine in the morning ;'' i. e.
ever since genuine poets existed, they have, scarcely with a single
exception, manifested an attachment to the juice of the grape. With
respect to the ranking of poets among Fauns and Satyrs, it may be
observed, that the wild dances and gambols of these froh'c beings were
regarded as bearing no unapt resemblance to the enthusiasm of the
children of song—6. Laudibus arguitur vini vinosus Homerus. ‘⁶ From
his praises of wine, Homer is convicted of having been attached to that
liquor.’⁹ Compare Il. vi. 261. Od. xiv. 4133. seqq. 7.—-Ennius pater. The
term pater is herc applied to Ennius, as one of the earliest of the Ro-
man bards.——Potus. “ Mellow with wine.''-Ad arma dicenda‚· an
allusion to the poem of Ennius on the second Punic war, in which the
praises cf the elder Africanus were celebrated.

8—10. 8. Forum putf‘alque Libonis. &cn “The Forum and the
puteal of Libo I will give over to tho temperate 3 from the abstemious
I will take away the power of song.” The Forum was the great
scene of Roman litigation, and the puteal Libonis the place where the
usurers and bankers were accustomed to meet. When the Forum,
and the puteal of Libo, therefore, are consigned to the temperate, the
meaning is, that to their lot are to fall the cares and the anxieties
of life, the vexations of the law, and the disquieting pursuits of gain.
Consult, as regards the term puteal, the note on Sat. 11. vi. 35.—‘10.
Hoc simul edixi. Torrentius first perceived, that the words which have
just preceded (Forum puteulque Libonis, ἃς.) could not be spoken
either by Cratinus or by Ennius, who were both dead long before
Libo was born 3 nor by Bacchus, who surely would not have waited so
long to publish a decree which the usage of so many poets had already
established ; nor by Maecenas, unless we read edisti and palleres, con-
trary to all the manuscripts. We must therefore consider Horace himselr
as giving forth his edict in the style and tone of a Roman praetor.-
Non cessavere pn'e'tae nocturno certare mero, &c. Horace here laughs
