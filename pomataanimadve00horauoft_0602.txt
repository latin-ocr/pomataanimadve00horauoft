558 Q· HORATII FLAOCI

Nam spirat tragicum satis, et feliciter audet:

Sed turpem putat inscite metuitque lituram.

ally employed by Faunus and the prophets, who delivered their oracles
in this measure. This was the most ancient species of measure em-

Cruquius, “ Doctas aures enecat oratio barbara. ”-160. Vestiyz'a ruris.

toned character.”—-166. Nam spirat tragicum satis, et feliciter audet.
“ For he breathes sufficient of the spirit of tragedy, and is happy in his

168—170. 168. Creditur, ex medio quia res arcessit, διο. “Comedy,
because it takes its subjects from common life, is believed to carry
with it the least degree of exertion ; but comedy has so much the more
labour connected with itself, the less indulgence it meets with 3 '’ i. e.
